"I had just completed running the New York Marathon and had requested an Uber Pool ride back to my hotel. First, let me tell you what started out right: The driver agreed to the pick up and drop off locations via the app. I then called and spoke with the driver to let him know that the pick up location was actually blocked off due to the marathon, and we agreed on another pickup location 1 block away before the race road block. Before I was picked up, I got a notification that another rider would be joining for part of my ride. I was picked up by the driver at the spoken agreed upon location; shortly the 2nd passenger was picked up and dropped off. Now here is where it all went wrong: Moments after continuing to my destination, I got a notification via the app on my phone that my ride had ended.I asked my driver what was going and he claimed, ""Gee I don't, I have another passenger to pick up now and your ride is over so you need to get out now"". Still confused, I asked him again how my could be over when we were still far from my agreed upon destination? This time he clearly played dumb, saying over and over again that he doesn't understand how is Uber app works, and I had to get out. In the middle of the street, by myself, in a strange location that was not even anywhere on my route.Not wanting to argue, as it was clear that he had a new ride request for another that would clearly be more lucrative for him, and myself not wanting to continue the ride with this jerk, I peacefully exited the car where I stood in front of a private residence mid-town, shivering cold in the 50 degree, rainy weather, in the dark, having just completed running the 26.2 mile marathon and wanting nothing more than a safe ride back to the hotel to seek much needed rest, warmth and safety. No sooner than I exited the car, the driver was already scrawling his new fare's name of a piece of paper and standing outside his car, in the street, to meet his new fare, not once even having inkling of conscientiousness for what he had just done to me. And the driver still had the nerve to charge me $10 partial fare!!Not excited to be using the Uber app again, but not on a street where any taxis were coming by and not having another other apps installed (such as Lyft), I requested a new ride. I was connected shortly with another driver that was 10 minutes away. 10 minutes is not an very long amount of time, if you are warm and safe, but again, dressed in running clothes, weary, and expecting to be a in safe warm car, I was stranded on the street to pace, alone, to wait for this driver. Also, this being not on a main street, and traffic very heavy due to the marathon rode closures, the 10 minute wait for him to be able to get to me was realistic. To my eternal happiness, he arrived within 5 minutes, and delivered me safely and nicely to my hotel.The next day, finding the only way to file a complaint to Uber was via the app. I sent my complaint and within a couple hours was replied to with a wet blanket apology for the ""inconvenience"" and offered me a $5 credit of the $10 I was charged. To make this even worse, Uber credited the $5 towards another driver, one we had taken the day before!! I wrote back to have this corrected, to not harm the previous day's good driver's reputation or take from his well earned pay, and to preserve my good relationships with all the other good Uber drivers I have rode with.Uber than wrote back with a full credit of my $10 (better, but certainly not enough to make up for the dangerous situation this driver put me in), and no mention of any discipline for this driver. I told Uber I would never use them again and would use Lyft from now on. Although all my many, many Uber experiences over the past few years that I have had have been 5-star, this one bad apple ruined Uber forever with me.",1.0,0
"My appointment time for auto repairs required a drop-off early am for it to be there and available for a mechanic to begin the work. The Uber app was easily installed on my mobile device and was followed with the required information being filled onto the blanks. When typing a phone number, it gave an order to check SMS texts for a confirmation code to be used along with the number. No text sent with first try at 7:30 am. More tries, no texts and had to give up. Four hours later the texts with codes were sent at 11:08 am. Two attempts were unsuccessful at emailing Uber headquarters in San Francisco that included a few lively suggestions. As follows; I suggest someone there unclog your ride summoning impacted website rectum by swallowing an online laxative, followed by a readily available Fleets enema from a pharmacy.I now must wait 1 1/2 weeks to have repairs done from being a no-show at the shop. That means safety concerns to drive as is. When using Uber once 9 months past, things went far better and a problem cleared up pronto by an apologetic and most courteous driver. What a letdown on this go round. If the world's greatest ability is dependability, why then are public service companies not aware of and learning such an important aspect of the business world? This incident is a second of its kind with the same problem and still no fix. Then, unlike now, I had made contact with their home base, only to be treated rudely and with great disrespect. Perhaps a reply is better not forthcoming after all. I at least have a choice of 4 codes and might need one to request service 12 hours ahead of when it is needed. Uber folks, you had oughta uncrimp the do-do contained in the app from the Google store.",1.0,0
"Whether I am using Uber for a ride service or Uber Eats ordering food the service has been terrible. Out of the 10 times ordering food from Uber Eats 9 times food has been forgotten. Every time I have requested a refund for the missing item until recently they told me to refrain from this type of behaviour and told me they would be restricting my account. Not sure why I should be punished for their drivers not checking the food prior to delivery. Recently while traveling I ordered an Uber to the place I was staying, I notified the driver it was a tricky place to find and even provided extremely specific instructions. I attempted to contact the driver numerous times but had no response. The driver cancelled the trip and I was charged a cancellation fee. I guess moral of the story is this company makes the consumer pay for their employees mistakes. Please refrain from using this service if possible, I know I'll be finding alternatives.",1.0,0
"Why is it so hard for you to understand that if I am trying to retrieve Uber cab, with the same email just a different phone number that it is me? If you say it is for security and you don’t recognize the phone number, then your security system is **. Because therefore if it was any good, your security system would link my original number to my new number which is under the same account and recognize that it is me. So stop rejecting my new number. What do you think I want everyone calling me on my private or personal number. Do not respond to this until you have fixed your problems. Or IT will only tell ""you people"" TO SHUT THE ** UP. And now I just tried to send this and you would not let me go pass 2. Why would I put any amount of stars when you serviced me zero amount of stars.",1.0,0
"I was in South Beach, FL. I was staying at a major hotel and ordered an Uber. The driver could not find me which was ridiculous. I was waiting out front of the hotel which was located on the main drag of SOBE. He hung up on me and charged me $5. I disputed the charge so now I have a credit on my account. Uber isn't available where I live. The last time I ordered a car in South Beach the driver hardly spoke English and couldn't find TJ MAXX. My advice... don't use Uber in Florida.",1.0,0
I had damage to my vehicle due to a Uber driver my upstairs neighbor used. The trim from the rear wheel well was broke off. The driver didn't leave a note. He kept calling my neighbor. Now he will not answer his phone. Can't get a number for Uber to locate the driver.,1.0,0
"I use Uber fairly frequently. Overall it has been a good service. I’ve had amazing drivers. You cannot call them. Only go through some steps to send them messages. I want to just call them if I have an issue. It’s so frustrating. However, two things have happened in a short time that will make me be very wary in using Uber in the future. Might just go back to taking cabs.The first didn’t leave us feeling good about Uber but we let it go. My brother called an Uber to pick us up from the beach. The Uber driver arrived with an Uber and Lyft sign in his window. We didn’t get a good feeling about him from the outset. He dropped us off at our home as arranged. He accepted a cash tip (this was before you could tip on the Uber App.) Later Uber retroactively charged my brothers card for $50.00 because the driver reported we had gotten sand on his floor mats. He picked us up at the beach... My brother contacted Uber and said that even though it was ridiculous in the first place, the $50.00 charge was not in line with their own criteria on their website. They refused to refund anything. Period.Now today, I see an email from Uber in my inbox. ""You rode with Dario 4.17 miles. Trip Time 00:12:04 Car UberX,"" with the following message: ""Adjustment Care due to different drop off locations. Ricardo (whoever that is), Previous charge: $25.35. Charged Personal **: $233.58. New Total: $258.93."" Plus I thought the driver was good and am a generous tipper in general so I also gave him a $10 tip through Uber.That is the most expensive 4 mile ride I have and will ever have taken. You can’t speak to a human and I get no email confirmation that my dispute has even been received. I have heard zero back. This is beyond horrifying. After now writing this I’m even more upset...",2.0,0
"Last night I returned home from the airport using Uber. Shared a ride. The other person paid $36.97 vs my $58.42. First stop was their residence (farther away from the airport than my place). Needless to say, I was not happy when I heard that my fare was 58 percent more. Uber says it's ""dynamic pricing"" and will not issue me a partial refund. And... with the company burning through its cash at over $1 billion a year and turmoil in the executive ranks, one would think the company might be more sensitive to such inequalities.The algorithms used by Uber are suspect. I live in a City that has contracted with Uber to provide local transportation free of charge...using a City vehicle. It took me 40 minutes to arrive at a destination that normally takes 5 minutes...picking up people along the way/dropping them off. I've shared my experience with the City, and they are aware of Uber's shortcomings...plan to address such with the company. Needless to say, Uber is struggling with the ""pool"" algorithms and has chosen to not work with its customers when inequities surface. Uber has lost a loyal customer!",1.0,0
"Do not lose anything in Uber otherwise your experience will be a nightmare getting them to recognize you. My friend had the ride set up however at the end of the trip I got dropped off leaving my wallet in the black leather seats, black wallet at night. Anyhow, my friend needed to provide verification about her account, no problem, except around 40 emails and 2 days later they didn't accept the email address from her account she provided at signing nor her phone number that she was calling from that she used for this ride. It was uselessness forwarding this info to them even as they weren't confirming her own or my accounts. It's mind boggling how the messages we were getting back were not recognizing the very content info we used for the ride. Not sure where their tech support is in terms of usability. I will not be letting them charge a $15 fee for a returned item to say the least! We are threatening police at this point. Apparently the driver has something it's Uber slowing down this whole process increasing the frustration.",1.0,0
My last 2 experiences with Uber have made me use taxis which turned out to be preferable to Uber. Two weeks ago called for an Uber and my driver did not speak or understand English so I immediately got out and was still charged on Tuesday. October 24th I requested an Uber to take me to midway airport. When I received notification that my driver had arrived--I called since I was already waiting outside. He informed me that he was in Lombard. And here I was at the place I am always picked up in Chicago. Guess I am on to Lyft.,1.0,0
"Our party of 6 consisted of three of my adult daughters and two friends going wedding dress shopping. We needed an SUV to accommodate all of us, and Uber showed a driver 20 minutes away in Sanford, Florida. Perfect, we thought as the reservation wasn't for another 40 minutes. We waited, and waited but the map showed the driver staying at the same place originally shown, yet the eta remained the same. We thought that the map must be frozen, so a reset was done, and then it showed that the driver had picked us up and was on route to someplace other than where we were going AND WITHOUT US! To make matters worse, our credit card was charged and we were very late for our appointment. There must be a way for Uber to assure that your card is being used for YOUR trip and not for someone else.",1.0,0
"75% of the time I'm extremely satisfied, but here are my pet gripes: 1) No flat rate from airport, as there are with taxis and limos. From JFK we got stuck at the midtown tunnel and my fare (time + distance) was almost twice the flat taxi fare. 2) The driver's profile does not indicate if they have a FasTrak transponder. Coming from LAX to DTLA on two occasions we were stuck in traffic on the I-110 because the driver didn't have FasTrak and so we couldn't use the express lanes. When a driver accepts the request, if the snapshot description (name, make of car, license #, etc) also had ""Can use FasTrak express lanes - Yes/No"" I would know to reject a pickup from a driver if they lack FasTrak. Another solution would be to have an option in my profile's preferences, to only accept drivers who have FasTrak.3) Drivers often don't know the city, relying too much on GPS and so unaware of their surroundings. Taxi drivers seem to know the popular destinations and fastest/shortest way to get there depending on conditions, whereas Uber drivers usually are like little automatons, staring at GPS and unaware that Waze is sending us on an unnecessary 5-mile detour. I recently had a ride to the Broad Museum in downtown LA from my home which is 4 miles away. The driver never heard of it, and his GPS wasn't working.When I told him it was on Bunker Hill, next to Walt Disney Concert Hall, The Music Center, and near the County Courthouse he had never heard of any of them. Those are all iconic L.A. landmarks - nobody should be allowed to drive for Uber if they don't know the fundamental layout of the city and its landmarks. 4) The Uber App on my iPhone hogs too much memory. I have limited storage capacity on my phone and so had to review and remove some items. The Uber app, >150mb, was one of the biggest apps and so I removed it. By comparison, Lyft's app is only 74mb.",3.0,1
I would file a class action suit against Uber. I do not use this service and get billed! My card was taken and used. This company is not checking identification to match cards used for service purchases. This company and/or drivers are allowing minors to ride without permission and are using unauthorized debit & credit cards. There is no direct contact number to resolve these issues unless you create an Uber account. Has this happened to anyone else?,1.0,0
"If I could give 0 stars I would. Uber has STOLE my MONEY and has made 3 unauthorized charges to my credit card. On top of that, they are not even taking responsibility for it and continuously keep marking my issue as resolved even though I have proof such as my bank statements. There is no phone number or place I could go therefore they are taking advantage of that. There are random charges on my credit card that total to over $30 and I did not use my Uber app for a few weeks. When I asked them to explain those charges they say they don't know and just ignore me and mark it as resolved. Also, just recently, I had to wait for 3.5 hours to have my food delivered through UberEATS, I called UberEATS and complained and all they said they can do is give me a 50% refund, and you know what? They DIDN’T give me that either! I have already called UberEATS 7 times now and they keep saying they will process it but they never end up doing it. As soon as I find a lawyer I am suing UBER for lying, for making unauthorized charges to my credit card, and more. It is ILLEGAL, federal crime to steal money.",1.0,0
"I had driven to KCVG to leave a rental car. Having used Uber oh let say a half dozen time in my life. I charge up my phone that had gone dead. Now at the Avis rental car return the system informed me to drive over to the terminal. This is after the Avis agent informs me ""Oh yes. Uber picks up here."" I follow the instructions Uber gave. I take the shuttle to terminal and do not summon ride until at pickup site. Here is the hurtful thing... Now I could be wrong. While I am looking at the drive from Lyft I get this call from the Uber driver... ""I am outside..."" the way the exchange starts.Look. That lie I can break down! 1. Within a minute of placing the ride I got a confirmation from Uber… ""four minutes."" 2. Then I get this text ""I have a flat tire. Will you please cancel?"" 3. I replied yes. Now this Old buffalo was not born yesterday. Being at the end my seventh decade of life and having grown up in a small town down south (Alabama)... I smell a RAT and he stinks to hell. Oh well to boot I see this $5.00 cancellation fee. Now I will say it was taken off my card. Finally the young fool has a callback number (I have a screenshot) and not quite smart enough to not respond or auto text me. I sent to number listed and got a reply... ""not me."" I smell a stinking RAT and it smell to HELL! By the way I have one of those free text message numbers you choose. I was not born yesterday.I came to this site since I could not write or speak to Uber. Soon to be in my eight-decade of life and this did not FOOL me. I could be wrong but I do not think so. You tell me how I get this to Uber. Since the trip was never made I could not write a review. Again I did get the five dollars credited back to my account. Old Buffalo and Coon and I do mean Coon!

"I used many times UBER rides in USA. I Visited Delhi India two weeks ago and had selected my card as the payment method but when I reached my destination the driver requested a cash payment. I thought maybe my credit card was not working here so I paid him cash, later I found out my credit card was also charged. When I requested the refund from Uber they give me excuses by automated reply like it's my fault I would have not given cash to Driver. What I supposed to do when driver is insisting to pay cash after completion of ride. At that time there was no way so I could confirm from UBER office before paying. Uber sent automated emails saying wouldn't have a refund option for this exact issue. SO NO MORE UBER.",1.0,0
"It's unfortunate to know that Uber allows its drivers to rate clients. My rating with Uber was 4.86 and after a recent trip out of town and used Uber my rating dropped to 4.63.

I will no longer ride with Uber and leave a driver who may be unhappy in his or her job or having a bad day or expecting a cash tip to rate me as a client and passenger. I treat all people with kindness and respect and my driver ratings have always been very good to excellent. You have lost a loyal customer.",2.0,0
"DO NOT ACCEPT RIDE WITH UBER DRIVER ""EDGAR"" IN SILVER TOYOTA SIENNA VAN!!! Me, my husband, and six year old daughter requested an Uber to take us back to the Sanford International Airport Wednesday, October 25th from Disney's Art of Animation Resort. We had a great experience with our trip to the resort the Wednesday prior with Mike who drove a grey Lexus. That fare totaled $40.49 and we tipped him $10. That said, we requested another Uber X for our trip returning to the Sanford airport with the same expected $40 fare - this was the fare provided when we accepted ride.We later got an email stating EDGAR adjusted the fare to XL due to ""the amount of people who rode"" -- we had THREE total. The fare more than DOUBLED to over $90!!! I had to submit several disputes to get this corrected and STILL had to pay MORE ($55.70) than the agreed rate of $40.

"We used Uber about 10 times over a week on an Orlando vacation instead of renting a car and had very good results except for the last trip from our hotel to the airport. The initial estimated cost was $21.86 and it ended up taking 20 minutes or so. At the airport we were shocked that we had paid $65.91 and the receipt showed a distance of 74 miles, a trip time of 53 minutes and the map of the route was different from the one that we had taken! We contacted Uber and they promptly refunded the extra cost. Very bizarre - I hope this is an isolated incident and that Uber investigates.

I have verified the receipt which is showing an amount of Rs.339.40 plus wait time Rs.3.22 total 342.62 but cash receipt has come for Rs.1324.47. How it is possible. It is possible if the driver continues from the previous trip. How the total of Rs.339/- has become 1324? Please explain. I have travelled with my daughter & hence I paid only Rs.500 after prolonged discussion (no use from your Customer care in spite of contacting).

"While it is wonderful to be able to get a driver with a ""tap"" of your finger, there is much more behind the ease of the process. I was a driver or a ""partner"" as UBER likes to call us. I drove for UBER for approximately 3 years without incident. However, their support throughout the three years is nothing I have ever experienced. It's predominantly offshore and only app driven. You cannot speak to anyone and the support ""messages"" or solutions are all canned or templates. There is no humanity for ""outside the box"" incidents. I recently had an incident on the freeway while I had a rider in the car. A motorcycle was ""lane splitting"" (in California) and deliberately punched my drivers' side mirror. When I reported this to UBER, they deactivated me and cited I was an unsafe driver. Again, I never had any other reports.After many hours of trying to get to ONE of the support representative, Paul, via online, that actually broke the template chain and conversed without script, I found the ONE live person in my area. I drove to meet this person. His name is Victor. Victor acted as if he understood my situation as he agreed that I never should have been deactivated and was communicating with PAUL and corporate to rectify. Victor never called me as he said he would. Uber deactivated my account and told me this decision final. They are terrible to their ""partners"", they do not have customer service, and they truly only care about money. We are all a dime a dozen and until we band together they will continue to maintain this low level of service.",1.0,0
"Uber drivers in Sydney (and other cities around the world ) have a bad habit of accepting jobs from miles away and sometimes up to 20mins, while still dropping off a passenger and while there are dozens of cars very close to the new job location. I had one this morning again to take me from home in Rushcutters Bay to work in the city and there were at least 6 cars within 1-2mins from my location. This the ** Uber driver, still took the job while still in the city some 15mins away. Uber needs to do something about this sort of behaviour as it ruins the customer experience and make people angry, if customers want ** service they would take a cab. The solution could be very simple, offer a function on the app for the users to manage a circular area around the pickup zone beyond which Uber drivers are excluded from picking up rides. Simple!!",1.0,0

If you look at where the driver took the client it was not to that place. Uber charged me $4.77 for a ride I never took and believed the driver over me. Rideshare should not be used If you can’t account for who took the ride. I was never picked up, the driver simply confused me with the other person. I had 3 rides scheduled but only picked up one time. Unfortunately, because of their growth, there’s no way to account for what is real and not. I had the same problem in Washington D.C. but was able to get refunded.",1.0,0

I ordered Uber in Seattle on 6/17. I was getting off a cruise ship and needed to go into the city. I contacted the driver that never arrived.

"I'm an avid Uber rider. On 9/30/2017, I ordered an Uber pool around 2pm. My fare was $8.98. The driver picked me up from my location. On the way to my dropoff, the driver picked up another passenger, dropped that passenger off. He proceeded to my dropoff, but he ended my ride by mistake. The driver had to load my dropoff address again. It's only after I got out the car, I realized my fare was duplicated. I've sent emails to UBER. They dont have customer relations, only email. They didnt refund me my money. On October 6, I used their service again. This time my fare was $30.92. This fare was obviously deducted from my Visa card and its also on my statement. On their app, UBER is claiming I have an outstanding payment, but I have PAID THEM. I need help.",1.0,0
Uber charged me again for a wait time when I was outside waiting for the driver to pull up. Today I watched the driver pull up and got into the car. I even texted the driver my location beforehand so there would be no confusion. Then I look at my online receipt and I see the charge. This is the third time Uber has done this. I think it is a scam. I rated the driver really low and will change it once someone verifies that the drivers aren't responsible for this. I can't get anybody on the phone. Uber's customer service is atrocious. I can't keep using a service that tries to scam me at every opportunity.,1.0,0

I am an Uber driver and have been only for a short time but all the passengers have said positive things about their rides. The company checks out all the riders before they are allowed to use Uber.

My son and daughter recently went to a concert at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn New York. For convenience my son ordered an Uber. The quoted fare was $57-$80.00. He was charged $81.52. After the concert he requested another Uber for the return home to New Jersey. He was quoted the cost would be $55-$75.00. When he left the car the final cost for the ride was suppose to be $75.22.The next day he received a fraud email from his bank stating that there were 3 charges of $130.80 pending on his account. He quickly called the bank to dispute those charges and he contacted Uber by email to also dispute the charges. He was later charged $130.80 for his return trip. He hasn't received any explanation for this overcharge price from Uber. Their accounting is poor and they will only dispute their issues via email. We have used their services in other states and have had no problems. We will never use their services again.,1.0,0

"The Uber driver cancelled the trip himself without consulting me. I was waiting for the driver to pick me up. While I was waiting, I received the email that the trip is cancelled and I was charged R25. I struggled to get hold of them to solve the problem, because everything is online with them. I managed to submit my complaint with them online. They took about two hours to come back. A Mr ** told me I must check that the reverse the money back into my account, which is not true. They only reverse the amount which they would've charged me for the trip but not the cancellation fees. I sent Mr ** an email again and told him that I was not reimbursed with the cancellation fees. He replied to me with an attitude in bold that the driver must get paid for a cancelled trip and at the same time the attitude is ""what do you further want us to do. The matter is resolved and like leave it and keep quiet."" I replied again and told Mr ** that I will take the matter further, because I had to make alternative arrangements. The driver just cancelled the trip and I was charged a cancellation fee which is not fair and I also told him he doesn't have to have an attitude with me to send me an email in bold. I'm very disappointed and disturbed, because I actually make use of Uber nearly every week sometimes twice or three times per week. I am shocked with what happened tonight and the kind of attitude which I received from them. If I was in fault I would've understand their attitude and behaviour. Kind regards.",1.0,0
"Uber's customer support via email is beyond words. The most horrible and worthless support group I have ever seen.

"I noticed that when I Googled Uber, they were giving free rides to new customers so I downloaded the app and attempted to add a payment method. I'm disabled therefore I receive my money on a prepaid (if you will) government debit card. The card is issued through the Bank of America from the government of the United States and Uber will not allow it as a form of payment, nor will they allow me to use my PayPal account which is attached to said debit card. I find this extremely prejudicial towards the disabled sect, as many of us cannot drive or even afford a car, making ride sharing a necessity. I've spoken to Uber drivers who find the map app to be incorrect quite often, getting them lost and making them late. They also find the politics of the company deplorable. Lyft, on the other hand does take my government of the United States issued Bank of America debit card, so I'll forego the old free ride bait and switch offered by Uber and ride with Lyft, a ride share company I've never had a problem with, whose drivers are friendly and on time, and don't have to ask me for directions; a company that understands that a prepaid card means the money is guaranteed.

"I booked an Uber XL from our hotel to the San Francisco International Airport with a 9 a.m. pickup. The quoted fare was $44-$57. Our hotel offered to take us for $17 per person, but we opted to take Uber for the personal service and efficiency. We had an excellent driver and vehicle but when we arrived at the airport I discovered that Uber charged me $99.26! The worst part about Uber is that they make it so easy to book a trip but then they make it so difficult to contact them regarding any issues.If surge pricing was in effect, they should have given me an estimate of the new price rather than surprising me with the price that was twice what they originally quoted. They have lost me as a customer because this is the second bad experience that we've had. The last one was in Philadelphia when we had two drivers cancel and left us hanging at the airport and the third driver to show up was in a construction pickup truck full of tools and construction material. We have maintained a 5 Rating, so there shouldn't have been any issues with drivers regarding our Uber rating. Uber customer service is completely non-existent and they rely solely on their website to answer any questions. In this day and age, that is completely unacceptable.",1.0,0

"We were left STRANDED in rural Framingham MA, after dark, with no way to return to our hotel. My colleague is disabled and must use a cane. The evening which would have been memorable for many other reasons I am sorry to say will probably remain memorable because of Uber’s actions. The problem all started when the driver showed up at our hotel, the Hotel Sheraton in Framingham, early on Saturday evening, September 24, 2017. We had dinner reservations for 5:30 that evening at a Framingham-area historic inn that both of us had been eagerly looking forward to visiting.We’d booked an “Uber"" ride that was to arrive a few minutes after 5:00 PM. When the car arrived early, he texted me from the porte cochere, ""SIR [emphasis added], your ride is here.” I carefully responded and noted that he was early. We were not ready. I went outside and spoke to him directly, and asked him if he’d like to wait for my invalided friend or simply leave. He preferred the latter. Fine. I requested an Uber ride again, and I watched on my smartphone as the TWO next Uber cars came and then just “disappeared” from view on the screen.Well, “PAUL” an Uber driver shows up; we get in. The car drives not 500 yards, and “PAUL” receives a text from Uber saying the ride is CANCELLED. Okay, something must have “happened.” I admittedly know just enough about computers to be dangerous. So I go back to my cellphone and re-request another “UBER” ride. It is at that point I received an error message to the point that my credit card (American Express) has been declined. What to do??? I called American Express, and they told me it was UBER that declined the payment. Uber declined the payment??? WHY??? That question has yet to be fully answered.After dinner, I requested a ride back to the Sheraton Framingham. I get the same error message: PAYMENT HAS BEEN DECLINED. We are sitting in the dark, in rural Framingham, Massachusetts, with a colleague on a cane, wondering how in the world are we going to make it back to the Hotel Sheraton?? We had been so looking forward to this genealogy conference, to going to this historic inn, and I am terribly sorry to say, the experience has been marred with our treatment by Uber. I shall uninstall the app and NEVER use Uber again.",1.0,0

I only had one incident that caused me concern after calling UBER and confirming a ride. Between 11:00-11:30 pm close to a price surge time, I was switched to several different driver confirmations which caused a 45-minute wait and that night I finally called a cab.",4.0,1

"I just had a terrible experience with Uber pool. I ordered it for the first time yesterday on a route that I've taken many times before with UberX. My phone is older, so the Uber app does not allow me to see the fare before requesting an Uber pool ride. However, I'd taken this ride so many times before with UberX and the cost was never more than $50. I figured since Uber pool claims to be up to 40% cheaper that UberX and it's a shared ride, I should be fine. Boy was I wrong! I ordered the pool and waited the estimated time but didn't see the car. I received no phone call either. Finally I noticed the car a half a block down past where I was standing. I went to the car and was told to get out because he had already cancelled. I was charged a $5 cancellation fee.I ordered again from the same location. 8 minute wait. Time goes by, no car. Suddenly my app switches from ""car is arriving"" to ""set your destination"". So the driver cancelled on me again. No phone call, never saw the car. Yet another $5 cancellation fee. About 10 minutes later I get a text from that driver with one word ""waiting"". But by then I'm in my third Uber pool heading home. I respond and get some automated response from Uber. After almost two hours (usually a 30 minute ride), because there were two other passengers, I get home and check the receipt. What is usually a $50 UberX ride is now a $114 Uber pool ride! I am stunned!So I email Uber. I demand they refund the cancellation fees and justify an Uber pool ride that is more than double an UberX ride. All I get is form responses that that was the rate. They claim surge charges. They try to claim the issue is resolved but I persist. Suddenly I see an additional charge of $48.00 on my credit card. I ask what this additional charge is for. No response. Only after numerous emails do they tell me that this was the quoted rate for my trip for the 2nd Uber driver who cancelled and that they would remove it. So how can they justify one trip being $48, and another trip ordered five minutes later for the same route now being $114??? I persist and they offer to give me $27 credit for Uber pool. Why would I accept Uber pool credit when my app does not show me the price upfront and I risk being charged double the UberX rate? So finally I told them I am only willing to pay $50 (the usual UberX rate) and expect a refund for all of the other charges. I still keep getting standard responses. I plan on filing a dispute through my credit card. I am absolutely outraged not only at the ridiculous pool price, but at the previous drivers’ canceling, and above all, at the incredible lack of customer service on the part of Uber. I requested contact information for a manager in numerous emails but was never provided with this information. At this point I will be taking my business elsewhere. I hear Lyft is much better.",1.0,0

I hear about Uber from friends that used it. They all say the same thing about this company and that is the ease of getting the service 24 hours a day and the price which is better than a taxi.,4.0,1
"I enjoy the cheap cost, but I feel saddened by the negative impact on the taxi drivers that have far better qualifications to drive people around. So many Uber drivers do not know the area in which they drive and are not safe drivers, often not obeying basic driving rules.",4.0,1
"I was in L.A. and a friend had the Uber account and software on her phone so she put-in the requests. I used Uber twice (maybe three times) in L.A... They were fairly short rides that went very, very well. The drivers were very friendly and the cars they were driving were newish and clean.",5.0,1
"For solo travelers, this is the best, cheapest, safest way to go. The savings vs a cab is tremendous. I used Uber in Philadelphia from a parking garage to a dinner cruise then to a outdoor festival. Even at midnight, they pick you up. Go Uber and stay safe.",5.0,1
I ordered an Uber today @ 9:45 for a 10:00 appt I had at the doc. At first I was told to walk over two blocks to meet the driver for my convenience. I waited around 15 minutes and kept on tracking the driver but no car showed up. After thoroughly checking the entire block I found him across the street. I quickly ran over but he informed me that my ride was cancelled and I'll have to order a car again. I did and they assigned me another driver (not this one) five minutes away. That driver canceled me after five minutes. I ordered another one but he never showed. I ended up walking the 1.2 mile to my appt. I will never use Uber again. They have absolutely no reliability and no customer service. I will try Lyft in the future.,1.0,0
"I had 4 guests (5 of us total) so ordered an Uber XL, which is advertised to seat 6 people. When I pulled up the order, I had the choice of an Uber X for $15 or an Uber XL for $35. Knowing that there would be 6 people with the driver, I ordered the Uber XL. When the car arrived, it was a small SUV (5 passenger vehicle) and the driver told us to ""squeeze in"". I have emailed Uber numerous times about this issue and have had no luck getting anything but an automated response saying that the issue has been resolved and that I should order an Uber XL for larger groups (which is what I did, but did not get an Uber XL). I have requested the $20 refund for the price difference with no success. It is not necessarily about the $20 - it is the principle. And it is also illegal for them to drive with 4 people ""squeezed in"" the back seat. It was embarrassing to me, as these were out of town guests. I do have 4 other witnesses that can verify the size of the vehicle.",1.0,0
Used their service for a week of vacation in downtown Chicago. Drivers were always available and service was quite prompt. The drivers and vehicles were clean and they were concerned for our safety by good driving practices. Even the pickup and drop off from the USA women's soccer game in Soldiers field was accomplished to our satisfaction even though the area was crowded with spectators. The prices were very reasonable. Very satisfied with the service.,5.0,1

The service is great.",5.0,1

"I had to use Uber for a few occasions when my car needed repair. I used the app which is really convenient to use. It shows you what cars are in your local area, how close they are to your location.

I started using UBER while on vacation in Arizona a couple years ago. Took it to and from the airport. I was shocked on how easy it was! I LOVE that there is no money that exchanges hands at all. I was a little leery about providing my credit card info when I signed up but I've never had a problem. I've used UBER so many times since then in different places... Like Chicago! It's just so much cheaper than a cab plus the drivers are usually very friendly and like to tell you about different places to visit (if you're a tourist). Recently I was on a trip to San Francisco and used UBER the whole time. Something new I learned about while there was UBER POOL. The driver picks up a number of people at different stops and drops everyone off at their pre-determined destination and it was only $4.99 per trip because you are sharing a ride with others. Very cool!,5.0,1
"There were two representatives for Uber at Westfield mall in Escondido yesterday, one ** one **. The ** man was staring at women's behind as they walked by!

"Uber began as a very reputable alternative to other livery services, however, that has changed. Rates are quoted as one amount and billed higher.

"Uber is great as long as you are traveling by yourself or with someone over age 4. If you're a single mom with a baby there are ZERO cars that offer baby seats.

There also aren't many women drivers, I have only seen one.",5.0,1
"Rates are very reasonable. Pickup times are pretty prompt. However, sometimes they come early then charge for wait time and a few times I had to wait on them.

"I was charged 208 Rand and received a receipt to reflect that amount. Then, I was subsequently charged an additional 60 Rand with no additional receipt or support for the adjustment. When I checked the Uber App, it shows a consolidated charge of 268 Rand, but conveniently state that the receipt is unavailable. Customer Service has not been helpful and have yet to provide me with any documentation to support the adjusted fare. Uber has progressively gotten worse over the years, so this is the last straw for me. They need to understand that they are no longer the only low-cost option and improve their customer service.",1.0,0
Same of your drivers have different things in their car. All drivers should care some extra things but I have always been happy with the service.,5.0,1
"I've used Uber many times in the past but I would never use Uber now! Many times I have been billed for rides where the driver literally drove right by me, and I'd have to call for another ride. You are automatically billed $5 if you miss your pickup. INSANITY! The procedure to get your $5 back that has literally been stolen from you is so time-consuming. It simply isn't worth the bother. I already had an unsatisfactory opinion of Uber - before all the HORRIBLENESS that they are today, June 13th 2017... So I'd say, try to catch a Lyft with someone else!",2.0,0
"I haven't had a problem with Uber until now. I ride Uber religiously to work every morning. I purchase their Uber gift card from their app's website. I always purchase a new one before the old runs out so that I have continuous funds. On Sept the 6th I started having major problems. I ride Uber now in the evenings to a new job about 2.26 miles. I currently have a gift card on file on Sept 6 for 50.00 and some change. I took Uber to work that evening but when I got ready to request the ride home it stated I had an outstanding balance of 1.20 cent from my ride to work that evening. I thought that's not right. I have over 50.00 on the gift card last purchased. Here I was at night outside my job trying to figure out where the mistake was. I sent Uber an email as soon as I got home stating I had sufficient funds for the ride why was the payment not applied to my gift card. I got an email saying the issuing bank denied the charges... what!!! The issuing bank is Uber and the card was purchased off the website through their app. The next morning the issue was fixed. The issue then occurred again on 09/7/2017. I got all kinds of response through the app that the bank had denied payment and I must put a new card on file. I stated I will not add a new card when I have already purchase their gift card that has now 47.00 and some change and should be used. Why am I going to put my debit card on file to take care of a balance when the gift card that does not expire has more than enough funds on it. One person even said, ""Well just in case you don't you will need to add a new card"". I became very angry because it made no sense!!! Finally a Rhona says the issue is fixed. I go look at my account and can see the gift card has been charged the full amount. Nobody could tell me why this was happening. I went and start trying to figure out why so I started with my receipts for the trip. I discovered that whoever is processing the payment is only applying 5.00 to the gift card. Except my ride for Wednesday was 6.20. They only credit 5.00 and left 1.20 owed so this 1.20 will not allow a ride request until I put another form of payment on file. It appears like they are trying to cause this issue by having people to add their debit and credit card. Why would anyone in their right mind do that when they clearly see that sitting on their account is a valid Uber gift card with funds that will cover several rides. The people that work for Uber all give different answers which is a huge CONCERN!!!You aren't charging my debit card when I already have your gift card on file with more than enough money to take care of the trip. I told them that this is a disservice to all especially those that ride every day. It is not fair and unjust and I am reporting also to the BBB. Once the funds on the card are used up I will no longer do business with them. I had such a great experience in the beginning. I've been riding for a long time but they have turned those experiences into a Nightmare!!",1.0,0
"I suddenly became very ill at work. I usually take the bus home, but was too ill to do that. I got on my phone and saw that many Uber vehicles were already circling my block at work, so a vehicle arrived promptly, before I could even come down on the elevator.

"I started using Uber about four months ago. My first two rides went perfectly. I was able to state where I was located, as well as the two locations that I wanted to go to. However, the third time that I wanted to use Uber, I was no longer able to put in two locations, just one. I didn't realize that at that point, and only realized it once a driver was driving me to my primary location. My driver was amazing enough to drive me to my second location; as thanks for this, I paid him with the few dollars that I had in my wallet.Just today, however, I tried to use Uber once more. Once again, I was not able to put in two destinations. I was only able to put in the one. Uber's Help page did not help at all; after many times of trying, I still was not able to see what the Help page told me that I would see. This was extremely disappointing, especially because of the fact that I had a coupon for Uber. I ended up using Lyft -- and will continue using it in the future. Although it did cost a bit more for me, Lyft allows for me to put in multiple destinations easily and without the hassle of turning to their Help page. In addition, after viewing the Uber webpage, Uber seems not to allow for people to give their compliments or complaints -- it only offers the answers to common questions that people may have. This is very disturbing, which also leads me to turning to Lyft in the future.",1.0,0

At first there was an issue with my charges... I was in the wrong and very nasty with Uber’s cust service. Because I felt I was being ripped off.

It was my first time using the service and I found it to be quite convenient. The app was easy to use. I was able to download it and then order the car quickly.

"I needed Uber when moving to Mexico City for work. I created an account and put in debit card, credit card, and PayPal accounts. Uber said the cards were invalid and that they could not connect to Paypal. I checked with my banks to make sure they had accepted the validation amounts sent by Uber. Uber NEVER contacted either bank to verify my cards. When speaking to Uber, they refused to address this issue. They merely told me how to add a payment method. As far as the PayPal problems, they just ignored that.While this was going on, I really needed to use Uber to get to and from work, so I bought a gift card thinking that would definitely be accepted. No, it was not either. They also don't take cash. I deleted my account and I expect the $25 to be returned to me. So far, the response is I will get a pin to redeem it. Not sure what that means, as they refuse to return cash to me. I will never use Uber again. I can see why they have a lousy reputation. The arrogance of their previous CEO infects the entire company.

Though it was not the driver that picked me, he also ""just happened"" to be another Uber driver.So I have no way of contacting Uber without getting into my Uber account, and no way of getting into my Uber account without my phone. I guess I will have to wait until my new phone comes. I mean common decency for a serviced based product is not unheard of Uber... I mean I'm not going to wipe the device so it's useless to them.

I recently took an Uber and was checking my trips the next day and see that I was being charged a cleaning fee of $150. My driver's name was Michael and picked me up in Delray Beach Florida and dropped me off in Boca Raton Florida. The ride cost $18.42. When I asked Uber through the Uber help I was advised I was being charged a cleaning fee. I then received pictures of vomit that was on the seat and the floor. This was something that I absolutely did not do. I have asked that the community manager in my area call me and I have not received any response. These pictures that were submitted were not from me. I feel violated and feel nothing I can do but dispute these charges with my bank.This now becomes a he said she said type of thing. The attorney general needs to be advised of what is going on with this and that some Uber drivers are extorting money fraudulently from riders. I have been an loyal Uber rider for 2 years and have not had an issue until now. I have attempted to resolve this issue with Uber and feel I was erroneously charged this cleaning fee for something I did not do.

"I never knew there is going to be such difficult task to contact Uber's customer service about an issue me and my husband had. In fact there is no customer service per se but a critical safety response line which wasn't much of the help in our problem. What happened is that my husband left in Uber his wallet with all his documents, id cards, credit cards, pictures etc. He really got stressed out about it a lot, we contacted Uber through an app right away as we were not able to reach the driver. You must know that you really can't reach the driver even though the Uber app would transfer your call to him. The driver never picked up his phone nor there was a voicemail set up so we could leave a message. From Saturday night until Monday night we didn't know anything about the lost wallet. At least he could call back or e-mail us that he found or didn't find it.If you ever read this driver Syed it's not about that we ""lost hat"" or not even about few dollars that were in that wallet, it's about all the stress my husband had to go through as he lost all his documents.

"I finally caved and opened an account with UBER in order to take a ride from Hallandale to the Fort Lauderdale Airport to fly home. I was under the impression that the first ride was free, but I could not find the place to enter the code. Nevertheless, I was picked up and dropped off for a charge of $17.94. Once at the gate, I thought I would go back into the app and learn about it, and perhaps discover where to enter promo codes. That's when I saw that a second charge of $97.94 had been applied. To make a long story short, and after a number of back and forth emails with UBER, it seems that my driver Yuniel, who could not speak a word of English, claimed that my dog (which I do not have) had urinated all over his seats. The UBER reply after the fourth email included photos.What I find absolutely astounding is that it would require multiple back and forth emails and much stressing for the following reasons: I was flying out of Florida and was not in the car with a dog. Had the seat been like that from a previous passenger, I would not have entered the car. I tried to save the picture to try to capture a time stamp, but their ""proof"" cannot be saved. UBER should know that I can have the charge reversed from my VISA, but that won't satisfy me, because that means the driver will still get his $97.94 for a fake cleaning charge. The driver should have known that if he were to make up such a ridiculous story, that he should have perhaps claimed that the passenger was ill (not that I want to give him ideas) or something more believable.OK - so the driver Yuniel is a thief. But for a company who has a reputation to maintain to go to this length to support a scam is disheartening. I am a 67 year old clean cut person who traveled without a pet of any kind, and I have been taken for a ride (no pun intended), and the company behind the driver so far has done nothing to resolve this except continue to send me emails with the driver's ridiculous claim. Through the magic of a snipping tool I present the photo the driver submitted. Would you have sat there? Not I. I will continue to write UBER until this is resolved. Unfortunately for the company, a single driver has eliminated all my future business with UBER.",1.0,0
"I live in San Francisco (city) and have been using Uber for about two years. About six months ago I had the first issue with two drivers that I had to report for violations. My score has always been 5 stars until then, but Uber is allowing drivers to leave a negative rating for riders that have reported them or left a negative feedback due to unprofessional, rude, dangerous behavior. My score dropped to 4.85 because of that. Yesterday afternoon I correctly and honestly paid for two seats (me and my spouse), and when the driver arrived the car only had one seat available. When we asked him to cancel the ride, he denied our request multiple times and stared at us in a creepy way. When he heard we were going to contact Uber immediately, he left us on the sidewalk with bags and kept on making us pay for a ride we weren't benefitting of.The two passengers in the back seats that were occupying my wife's seat didn't bother to move enough to allow her to sit, and from their unpleasant behavior we understood they were at fault as much as the driver, since they must have paid for one seat only (causing the main problem). The driver, in retaliation, damaged my profile score and now I have 4.82 stars. I have been working hard to restore my score after those bad drivers damaged it months ago, but it seems like riders have no way to protect themselves from similar behaviors. We are constantly at risk of finding unpleasant, arrogant, lazy and even dangerous drivers, and Uber Customer Care doesn't care: all I was able to obtain was a refund, but when I asked them to restore my score I ended up in an infinite loop of excuses and explanations about how their policy prevents them to modify riders and drivers' score.There is no way bad drivers can be allowed to damage the reputation of good customers when the same customers are reporting an issue with them. I have informed Uber that I have all the rights to move legally, despite what they claim in their fake policy. In particular, don't let Uber's ""arbitration clauses"" which prohibits customers from suing the company scare or stop you from fighting for your rights: in April, a California court ruled that the obscured its terms of service and privacy policy on its sign-up screen, meaning the rider suing the company was not reasonably notified that he was giving up his right to a class-action lawsuit.Finally, talking about privacy and defamations, if you have been involved in a similar situation be aware that, despite what Uber claims, your rider's profile is NOT private: it only requires one person to see it (the driver) for it to be ""public"". And many are the drivers that takes advantage of a low score to avoid picking you up and behaving badly in any other way. If a driver damage your score as a retaliation for having been reported and given 1 star, then both Uber and that driver can face a lawsuit.",1.0,0
"Uber charged my card for a ride that did not take place. I was notified by my bank of an Uber charge on a weekend during which I never left home. Attempting to contact Uber by phone, or submit a fraudulent statement via their website both proved impossible. The last Uber contact number would not recognize my phone number. Their website would not permit the required screen shot of the fraudulent bank transaction. Ultimately, I resorted to closing the card, reasoning if it happened once, it will certainly happen again.

"I was recently in Seattle for a fun trip. Used Uber several times without a problem. But then all of a sudden they charged me $250 out of nowhere to which they never did respond. But thank God my bank denied that fee. Then I asked for a ride, they cancelled on me, yet said I was not at the location I requested, then charged me $5 for a cancelled ride, NOT!!!

"Attempting to schedule a ride with Uber using their app failed 6, 8 or more times because the app could not verify the card security code on the back of the three credit cards I had entered into the app. I was returning home from shopping with frozen goods and was relying on Uber to get home. After several failed attempts, I noticed that Uber had shifted into surge pricing and then into a still higher surge pricing. I finally was able to schedule a ride. However I believe I drove up my own rate because I had requested so many rides until the app took hold. I have asked Uber to investigate my concern and have not heard back from them, and my original message has been deleted.",1.0,0
"I'm a Uber driver and I took a couple of riders happens to be a husband and wife. When I picked up the riders, the women (wife) was badly intoxicated and sitting on a sidewalk. It was my first time so I didn't know what will happen next. I picked them up from LA and we're headed to Torrance at 1 am. By the time I nearly got to their destination, the wife threw up in my car. The husband helped catch the puke onto his shirt but since it's liquid, most of the throw up soaked into my back leather seat and couldn't do anything about it. I did completed the trip to their home and they got out of the car. Since it was my first experience with a rider throwing up in the back seat, I didn't know what to do or how to claim for clean up fee. I used my wet towels to clean up the threw up and was able to wipe out the pukes on the back seat. The alcoholic smell wasn't gone and left my car with horrible puke and alcoholic stinks. I spend nearly more than 10 minutes cleaning and had to open the whole car windows because the smell was bad. My car was just fresh brand new less than an year old Lexus IS. I found in the app that I can request a cleanup fee via Uber. So, I took the pictures and sent the pictures with explanations of the situation of what happened to me because of a rider. I couldn't drive due to alcoholic smell so I had to return home. The next day, Uber customer service contacted me via email. Here's what they said: ""If you submit photos of the damage that clearly show a mess, including a wet seat etc., with an explanation of what happened, within 48 hours, we would be happy to look into a cleaning fee for you. The photo you submitted did not show any mess, and we cannot charge the rider if there is no evidence of a mess. I apologize for any inconvenience here. Thanks so much and Uber on!"" After exchanging over 20 emails over 3 days, the Uber didn't pay a penny nor tried to help me on cleanup fee on my car. I was really disgusted and tired of Uber customer's attitude towards the drivers. I heard that Lyft pays $250 straight up detail fee if a rider throws up in the car. As you all probably have dealt with and have experienced with Uber and their drivers, they all say Lyft is much much better for drivers and riders both when it comes to satisfaction.",1.0,0

I don't think so. No one really read my complaints. I kept emailing until my last email said ""sorry your ride was more than 30 days out, closed"". I have emailed several more times with no response.

"UBER does not care about drivers and their vehicles!!! For most issues, they have people responding in the Philippines (initially they say ""We are offshore""), who are trained to use initially prepared ready texts. Those guys do not disclose any unique info like employee ID, ext., initials etc., imitate work on the issue, imitate care, imitate responsibility. Every time a different person responds under the veil of anonymity. You can't talk to a manager. Their system is designed to discourage drivers to resolve their issues, to confuse them and distance them. On top of all, UBER doesn't want to be sued. They want arbitration!

"ON 7/30/17 I was in Oregon alone on a trip at the University needing a ride to PDX to get home to CA. I chose Uber over Lyft because they had a driver available and the time of arrival worked for me, I was to arrive at 5:11 to the airport PDX which would have been plenty of time. But with him getting lost to me looking for gas. And me having to use the app to guide him to my pick up locations I ended up being 45minutes late which therefore made me miss my plane. I'm sorry. This is unacceptable from Uber, feeling helpless at the time and that was not what I was quoted. My time that you gave me was to ARRIVE at 5:11 to PDX that gave me 1:35 min to catch my flight I WAS 45 minutes late!I MISSED MY FLIGHT BECAUSE HE STOPPED FOR GAS AND COFFEE. That is unacceptable. I don't know what was going on with my driver but he was definitely not thinking to make pit stops and to take the streets to the airport >50 miles away. He refused to take the freeway the first time I asked then after he finished his coffee he said ok but by that time things didn't look too good. Thank you. I feel Uber should not be able to assure times and routes if they can't control their drivers. There was no traffic at 3-3:30 in the morning, no reason but the drivers for me to miss my flight!",1.0,0
I had bought an Uber card so I will have a way to work for pretty high amount! I was allowed to use the card at first but then I cannot use it anymore. I try to go through customer service but it's no good. They run you around in circles and they took money out of my account after I bought the credits. They tell you to do this and do that and once you do it is still do not work! The Uber card is a scam! I really didn't want to put a star because it is 0 stars for me.,1.0,0
"I feel compelled to let people know they are not the only one seeing hidden charges show up after a ride. I recently was in Boston and actually ran down the street to get in the car early so the driver did not have to stop up further in heavier traffic and was charged a wait time charge? How the heck does that work? No response from Uber yet as just wrote to them. The driver was very nice and a good ride to my destination but that fee is so pumped up just to make more money and I was right at the door of the address I put in that Uber agreed to pick me up at for $14 ride.So over $15 now as the ""wait charge"" that there was no wait for was put on there. Also, a couple of weeks ago, here in Albany, NY, a $15 charge was what was quoted, but after getting the receipt the breakdown showed a toll and an Uber worker's comp charge. Hmmm, no toll road was taken so what the heck happened there? So I'm starting to think this is not a coincidence, however will print out my itemized receipts with route taken and hold until I decide if I am going to report this and to whom. Uber was sooo great when started out. Honest, nice cars, great drivers, and you were billed one fee and knew what it was going to include up front. Again, neither of my situations happened that they billed me for and when you respond to them with the issue, they tell you that is the charge and it is what it is. Signing up for Lyft today. Hearing great things about them and perhaps they want my business more. I think Uber may have issues people. Watch your receipt breakdowns.",2.0,0

"I have honestly lost track of the number of times I have had a frustrating experience with this company. It's got to be at least 10 at this point, within the past year. Each time I attempt to resolve the problem by contacting them through their website, as there is no option to speak with a human being. The process of attempting to communicate with them is, every single time, another giant frustration. I had decided to just stop using their services, as there are many better choices out there (thank you Lyft), but was recently enticed by an email I got offering unlimited $5 rides for a month. I decided to buy the ""pass"" for $5, which would then ""unlock"" the $5 rides. I just arrived home to see that I have been charged $17 for a ride which showed up in the app as being $5.

It never seems to have a problem with my connection when it comes to excessively texting me messages, urging me to become a driver or remembering my credit card information. I never requested info to become a driver, only a rider. When I went online to contact ""customer service"", my only option was to fill in a generic field box.The customer service number is hands down, the flimsiest excuse for a lack of phone support I have ever heard. It is only a message that tells you to e-mail them and they will get back to you in 24 hours. When I need a ride now, an e-mail is not going to solve my problem. I have tried 3 e-mails in 72 hours and I have yet to receive a reply. Direct quote, ""More often than not, phone messages are incoherent and can slow down our ability to provide customer support"". How about actually answering the phone or use an automated call back service? Or have chat support on your website? Calling a cab may be pricier, but much less aggravating.

It's August 2nd here in Dallas Texas and it is raining very hard. I called for an Uber ride to go to an ortho appointment that I have at Parkland Hospital. I was involved in horrific accident in January and my leg was nearly severed and it was saved from being amputated. I've been in a wheelchair for months today was my first to leave the house without a wheelchair or a walker to go to an appointment. It was pouring rain and the driver pulled up.I close my umbrella and I was trying to balance myself and get myself into his vehicle and he got mad because my umbrella was wet and got water on his vinyl seats and while he was busy throwing a fit he I was standing outside of the car but not allowed to get in until I can move on umbrella and he can dry off the seat. Show being very off put and he was very rude to talk. I told him I would get another driver. Uber did nothing about the matter and they charge me for the cancellation knowing that I'm on a fixed budget and needed that Rideshare money to go towards another driver that I would have to hire from Uber.Two weeks before that I had another driver who refused to stop at 5 in the morning to take me to an appointment because she did not like our neighborhood. She was from a nicer neighborhood and she said she didn't feel safe picking anyone up in our neighborhood so I asked her why she bothered to take the trip in the first place and then again I paid for a cancellation.,1.0,0
"I am an active user of Uber and so, when I saw the service was available in France during my recent vacation, I used Uber rather than a taxi. I left my iPhone in an Uber last Thursday in Bordeaux. I immediately tried to log in to my account and contact the driver but apparently, because I was in another country, they required I provide a verification code - which was sent to my phone, which was in the Uber driver's car. My friend, who is also an Uber user, contacted Uber through her app to file an inquiry on my behalf. We have no less than 10 emails from Uber customer service, a different person each time, asking me/her to file an inquiry online - which would always lead to the service sending a verification code to the phone.I finally got France Uber to contact the driver on Saturday, two days after the phone was left in the car, and return the phone. The driver, who met me at the hotel, told me that he had contacted Uber about the fact he had my phone 5 minutes after I had left his car on Thursday. Because of their ""privacy"" policy, I could not contact him and he could not contact me. We had to coordinate it all through Uber and their Customer Service and whatever CRM system they are using to track passenger inquiries sucks. Unbelievable for a company of their size.",1.0,0

If I hit your vehicle you will stop so I can go the left edge of the road to drop my passengers."" This is how the Uber drivers are. Uber is encouraging and teaching their drivers to hit and kill people in order to drop their passengers on time. We are on one way road. He at least does not know that it is one way. He says ""this is two way so I can go to any direction that I want."" Very strange people on earth. This is how the social responsibility of the Uber is. Great organization.",1.0,0

Uber car service is selective on certain customers in offering flat fare packages deals. If you're a customer that normally spends 15 or more you will never be offered it.

I contact customer service they told me to prove it was offered which was really horrible to even go through and I screen shot it and sent it to them. They apologize and said they was sold out and I would receive it on the next month. Not. Again my friend that barely catch Uber was offered it again and I'm with this 25% mess. Uber get lost.

"I'm driving for uber, of course as idea uber is a very unique company but bottom line it is taxi company. Only in taxi companies drivers may be non professionals but in uber company I can't see anything that american. Number one being unique company it's not enough to be the great company, and bet is very dirty cheating company, and they cheat not only customers, they cheat drivers, and that automatically mean they cheat government. I warn every customer, driver check your trips mileage and time and compare with charges and you will be surprised that is not matching reality, some small some big but it will be different. Even small different is cheating and if you may multiply that cheating to quantity of trips daily it will be millions, monthly will be billions. Is this is American way? I don't think so.When driving over 30 miles, but they paying you for 12 and trying to prove that on their gps is that much, when they charges customer but do not paying you, when customer give you tip but it is not reaching your account, when they charge customer and paying you less than 50 percent when it's must be 75, when for 3 month can't fix problems with app in area, I can continue this line list, just check every trip and let's not allow cheating even for penny I think that is real American way.",1.0,0
I waited at the same spot at the airport. Car was 7 minutes away. I waited for 15 minutes until the car arrived. Yet Uber charged me waiting time!! The charge was very small but this is a question of principle and honesty. Is this due to improper reporting by driver and if so how can I correct this erroneous reporting.

I used the Uber ride and secured Uber pool for the price of $18 and change. When I receive the receipt for the ride it was for $22 and change.

"I have had several issues with Uber especially their navigation when a 10 minute ride with any other service takes 25 minutes to an hour because of their application. I had my last straw yesterday as I requested an Uber that was three minutes away only to stand and wait for 25 minutes. Of course Uber only gives you two minutes to cancel so almost every time this is the case, the extra charge of almost a dollar is certainly a scam as they probably are adding this to many unknowing customers and making a lot of money on this. I don't always pay attention to the email receipts that come in. They even indicated that there is a hold put on my account for the lower amount and then turn out charging me more. That prompted me to look on your side and I was shocked to see the lack of customer service. On another note it is almost impossible to have a conversation about a customer experience with Uber. I have tried several times in the past. They are not interested in knowing what the customers think. They also force you to rate their drivers poorly when it is their fault often times because their application and send them to the wrong location. I am done with Uber!",1.0,0
"I purchased an Uber gift card in the amount of $25.00 for my son to use. He tried to redeem it, however Uber asked him for a credit card which he does not have... Hence, me buying the Uber gift card for him. In an attempt to satisfy Uber's request, I purchased another gift card for $25.00 thinking this could act as the secondary. Instead the Uber app requested my son provide credit card info again. So, I finally caved and provided a credit card to my son as a back-up payment to satisfy Uber's request. They made such a mess in my account that the bank automatically shut my card down. First, Uber charges your account, then they reverse the charge, but this is done over 12 consecutive times causing alerts to my bank. Without knowing, my son at the time purchased another gift card while I had purchased the 2nd gift card listed above in the amount of $25.00 and of course, he cannot use that one either unless credit card information is inputted into the Uber app. This is dishonest business. How can this business sell gift cards if they are NOT going to properly redeem them?There are lots of consumers that do not have credit card, so the gift card is a good alternative. However, this is much more trouble than it is worth. Uber should NOT be allowed to sell gift cards. Can you imagine buying a gift card to the movies or a retail outlet and then being told they need your credit card information in order to redeem them? How does Uber get away with this business practice? This really causes undue stress to people such as myself who find themselves in this situation, as well as can place people into unwanted situation of proving credit card information.",1.0,0
"I have had several recent issues with Uber. I requested an Uber in New Orleans and the driver never showed up. I followed the route and according to the driver they picked my husband and I up and dropped us off at our destination. This did NOT happen.

When I contacted Uber about being charged but not receiving the ride they stated that the driver checked in and said the ride was given.

I was so angry because I was charged for an Uber xl but received a 4 seater car. We had a specific timed reservation that we could not miss. So I took the trip against better judgement and paid an Uber xl fare when it was clearly not an Uber xl. While in the car I had to ask the driver to please change the radio due to language. He was listening to hardcore rap music with extremely vulgar content with children in the car. It was totally offensive and inappropriate to me at 59 years old, but to have my grandchildren have to be subjected to it was incredibly offensive and impolite. I sent Uber a complaint on their app but was met with rudeness and incompetence. They stated that the car was an Uber xl according to their policy. I sent pictures of their policy along with a description of the car that picked us up, which clearly states that it is a 5 seat compact SUV (that includes the driver) and Uber still responded in a negative manner.

I was 1/2 hour late for my dinner appointment. SCAM! Check out the GPS. Unbelievable. GPS it for yourself. Should I really have to give directions and WTF on the miles?,1.0,0
"Today I pick customer up but I wait the 4 minute but he not come out so I did call to him. He not hold the phone so I did cancel it. He come out after I did cancel. I did said call Uber again because I did cancel because rider is no show. He told me that uber is cut money $11 his account. But whenever driver did cancel, uber not pay any money because driver is cancel. I did show to rider I already cancel and I show my account cancel is $ 0.00 so not get any money from customer if I did cancel. Customer need to call uber and refund money.We don't want to drive more because we go to pick up passenger while on the way, customer is cancel. We are lose the gas. Uber is not pay for that free. And then we wait the passenger 2 minute that time is free. We lose the gas too. We sent far passenger house while sometimes we come back, not get any passenger. We are uber driver and also Lyft driver but we don't want to drive it more. Use own car. Spend gas and we get them a little money.",1.0,0
"Uber charged me for faults in their mapping system. I was charged Rs.50 in excess when I booked through UberPass. My fault - I asked the driver to drop me at the front gate of my office when Uber mapping system was showing the drop location as the back gate (Exit only). The funniest part is that to reach the back gate I had to go 1 km extra. So I was literally charged extra for saving my time, the driver's time and fuel. I understand that computers can be faulty at times. But when I contacted customer care the human (I assume) gave me the same script. What is the point of having a human out there if they don't understand logic?",1.0,0
"While staying in Champions Gate, FL, my daughter and friend got an Uber estimate into Orlando at $28 and the return estimate was $28. The first driver took them for the 30 minute drive and dropped them at Church Street after 11 pm. The return driver picked them up around 1 am and brought them back to the hotel 30 minutes and the charge was $63 and stated that it took an hour and 30 minutes. On the map you can see the drive around Buena Vista which was unnecessary. If you know Orlando, you know it's a straight shot on I 4. I drove I 4 that day and there was no construction. It took two emails to get an answer from Uber and they were all over the place with their excuses. Made no sense because it was a straight shot there and a straight shot back. I have used Uber many times but no more. I will use Lyft or go back to old fashioned taxis. How can this business survive with no real customer service?",1.0,0
"After a night out one weekend, a friend called an Uber for me (because I was pretty drunk, and they wanted to make sure that I got home okay). While in the car, I felt like I needed to puke, so I opened the door and did so outside. NOTHING went inside the car, aside from a few small splashes on the plastic of the door. I offered to go buy a water bottle and rinse that off, the driver said that was fine, and while I waited in line at the store, he took off. Left a drunk 20-something girl on the street, not ensuring her safe arrival home. Both myself and my friend who split the fare with me were charged a small fee - UNTIL our visa statements came where we saw a $75 cleaning fee EACH on top of the ride charge. I spoke to many friends and acquaintances, some of whom actually told me that they puked inside an Uber, and were charged $50. I tried to get in touch with Uber. Mind you they have no 800#. Opened a ticket in order to get in touch with them, they reply back saying they have policies and put ""resolved"" immediately, which prevents you from being able to write back again. I opened several tickets, in regards to the same issue. Wanting answers, why my friend and I were each charged so much when the vomit wasn't even inside the car. They were extremely unprofessional, even after I asked them to stop closing the ticket they kept doing the exact same thing. They sent me pictures with the first ticket zoomed into the vomit OUTSIDE, the pictures expire fairly quickly and because I could no longer view them, I asked to have them resent, they just ignored my request. I explained that, aside from this incident nothing like this had happened to me before, I have a 5* rating on the app. That I understood having to pay a fee, but that this was extreme and kindly asked them to reverse at least my friend’s charge, who was not even in the car at the time, but they're unprofessional, give you short answers and close the tickets each time. Definitely wouldn't recommend this service, they have access to your credit card information and will use it however they see fit. Obviously don't have proper guidelines when my friend who puked inside the car was charged 3x less than I who puked outside. There's no way to remove your credit card information from the app, unless you are to put a new one - I would never give them my information again. For a company that fought so hard to come into this city, they show that they don't care about customers at all. Completely unwilling to work with you and meet you half way.",1.0,0
"Uber has overcharged $150 dollars for a bogus cleaning fee. I have communicated with them letting them know it was a mistake since we took a very short ride and no accidents happened. They insist that the driver sent pictures for a mess in the back seat and that the charge was valid. There were two of us, we are in our 50's we were picked up at 11:29 pm and dropped off at 11:39 pm. The pictures are not clear, they show white particles on one side of black seat behind passenger seat. They are still insisting the charges are valid and no refund will be processed. Their time stamp on the incident report is 11:26 pm, obviously we were set up by driver. Shame on them, for what I see online this has happened a few times before. I am filing this report for people to be aware of this scam, take pictures before and after when using UBER services.",1.0,0
"I have been driving for Uber for almost 4 months and never had any issues till recently. I received a rider's request, as we can only see the destination until we start the trip, I get to the pick-up location to find out that the trip is an 8 hours trip almost 9 hours which was from Iowa to Ohio. That wasn't a problem because I needed the money. I started the trip, drove to the destination and completed the trip with 5 stars. Right after completing the rating the app logs me off, suggesting that I get back to my home location for me to be able to go back online. The app froze and there was nothing else I could do in it. The red message suggesting that I go back to my home location was the only thing I could read. When I got back home (Iowa/Cedar Rapids) I turn the online button on, I check the trip history. The trip is nowhere to be found. I wasn't worried very much as I usually get issues like that with the Uber app but after a few minutes the fare end up showing. I kept waiting until I decided to contact them, they sent me an automatic response suggesting that I should be patient and that it should take up to 48 hours for the fare to show in the app. I have waited for more than 48 hours but nothing is being done. I contacted them on numerous occasions but all I get is a loop of same responses. As per now I don't even get any response any more. It has been a week since that happened and now I have nowhere to address the issue. The trip cost the rider $501 and I used my gas money nearly $110. I contacted the rider because he gave me his personal phone number. He says he has seen his receipt either but his has no problem if the issue get fixed and he get charged for the trip. This experience makes me think twice when I get any trip that would last like an hour and above because it is clear now that if there's anything wrong with the app I will lose but not them. This kind of treatment is beyond inhuman. I can't believe these are the kind of people I am working with. And they also treat issues or report that they get in a partial as long as they don't lose. They will favor whichever side that will make them win or not lose anything.",1.0,0
"On Thursday, July 13th, I received a text from a male driver that he was looking for me and then a voicemail. 45 minutes later, I received another voicemail from a woman saying she was looking for me at a location. I NEVER requested an Uber. I only signed up to this account on Wednesday, July 12th and used the service once to go from the airport to a hotel. Now I have a charge to my account for a ride I did not request or take. I have sent multiple e-mails back and forth to Uber whom they claim after reviewing, they see that the charge did come from my phone device and this does appear to be a valid trip which was charged appropriately for the time and distance traveled, so we will not be able to make any adjustments to the fare. They also suggested to follow up with anyone who may have physical access to my phone to see if they have taken a ride and work out the payment details with them. Again, I was alone and had just opened the account, no one else had access which I re-iterated multiple times and they still send the same generic response.",1.0,0

Uber then refunded me $9.99 to my credit card so I closed the disputed upon received the credit.However, Uber places $62.24 on unpaid on my account. My credit card statement stated that I paid the original $62.24 for that trip. I confirmed with Citibank Visa that the bank paid to Uber successfully. I sent Uber the credit card statement indicated that I already paid. However, Uber insists that it is unpaid and demand me to pay again $62.24 on a different card.

"Trying to get help. On June 29, 2017 Uber started working in Long Island. According to uber if you want to drive you don't need special license special Insurance TLC license, not even a new car 2002 or newer.

It was hundreds of people doing it so I was all set to go just wait for June 29 to start driving.

One was already in the mail but in the meantime print a copy and put here in front of my car so I did just like I was told. Runs everything was going smooth. I did six seven runs. The last one was going to Mineola train station. I dropped the customer off in TLC. Officer came up to my window ask me for license insurance registration. I got three tickets one of them was for the decal. I told the officer that's what I was told by Uber to put in my car. I showed him the text. I shown the emails. He basically told me to tell them to the judge. They know that having a copy isn't legal and because the illegal decal I got two more.

"I was returning from a veterinarian's clinic with a very old dog in the back seat. My return route carried me through a neighborhood in which I had resided for 12 years; and, the maneuver from a side street, across San Pedro Ave., where the incident occurred, had been made by me thousands of times before, without incident.At approximately 2:15 p.m. I pulled up to the intersection of Thames Dr. and San Pedro Ave., with the intent of crossing San Pedro, and taking an almost immediate left onto Sprucewood Ln. I looked both ways, and observed traffic just beginning to move southward from a traffic light up the hill; and, to the south, traffic proceeding down the hill, heading northward, at a good distance. It was one of those rare moments when the maneuver was easy, as no traffic was within enough distance to cause concern, or require any degree of extra caution. I crossed the 2 south-bound lanes of San Pedro, and turned right into the center turn lane, proceeding about 50' to where I would turn left, and cross the 2 north-bound lanes of San Pedro, onto Sprucewood.At the exact moment I began to move my steering wheel to turn left on to Sprucewood, I was clipped/struck, with little noticeable impact - mostly noise, by another vehicle, without warning - no horn or screeching tires, on my left side, at the almost direct center of the front wheel flare. The car, a black, 4-door sedan, about the size of a Chevrolet Impala, which it may have been, pulled into the center turn lane a few feet in front of me. I was somewhat stunned with the development, and immediately concerned for the dog, given the heat was about 100 degrees, and which, amongst other issues, suffers from incontinence - although he had just recently relieved himself at the veterinarian's.As we exited our vehicles, I was further stunned with the damage to my car, whose front end was ripped almost completely off. The other driver and I approached each other, between the vehicles. He was tall, about 6'3-5"", weighing about 200-210 lbs, clean-shaven, with reddish blond hair, with no noticeably visible tattoos. He was amiable in demeanor, and immediately asked, ""How do you want to handle this""? Being in a shocked state, I said, ""I don't know"", as I was still trying to get my bearings, and take everything in, and wondering what I would do about the old dog. He responded with, ""I'm an Uber driver; and, I have a fare, and need to get going"". There was a person, who appeared to be a female, sitting the rear seat, on the passenger's side. I indicated I had the dog in the car, and needed to get him home. I said, ""let's look at your car"", while, w/o close inspection, was thinking the damage to mine was mostly cosmetic, which subsequently proved to be erroneous. We proceeded around to the front of his car to observe the right front area, which had only a small dent in the front corner thereof. There was also a roughly 3' white/silver scratch down the center of his car, mainly on the rear door, w/o a noticeable dent. At that point, still in a confused state, I asked, ""where did you come from""? He indicated the parking lot on the east side of San Pedro, from which the exit was probably 100-150' above where I had crossed San Pedro and into the center turn lane. He impressed upon me, again, his need to get moving with his fare.We returned to our position between the cars; and, I asked if he had something to write with. He went back to his car, as I pulled out my insurance card, and a business card with my phone number, which I handed to him while indicating that the email was not @grandecom.net, but rather @Gmail. He took a picture of my insurance card w/his iPhone, and handed it back to me, while placing my card in his shirt pocket. He indicated he would call me later that evening, and immediately took off. Still being somewhat disoriented, I failed to get his license plate number, but have a strong inclination that it started with H, and had a 5 in the last set of numbers. I then called a friend, who came and got the dog, and returned him home, while I tended to get my car towed to a repair center, and reporting to my insurance co. I have had no contact from said individual. A subsequent visit to scene, to take pics, which show no skid marks.On Friday, June 23rd, I went to Uber's local ""Green Center"", where I spoke to one Tony **, who indicated that office did not having access to Uber's fare logs, and indicated he would ""escalate"" the matter to a district/regional mgr. who did. He also indicated he would discuss the matter with in-house management in a meeting to follow soon thereafter. I was thereafter told, by said person, via email, that only insurance companies and the police will be given that information because it would ""violate Uber's Service Policy"". On Sunday, June 25th, I reported this to the police, who issued an ""incident"" report, not a ""crash"" report #, which is what the traffic investigation unit needs, ""if I want to file charges"". A call to the officer to obtain such number, has not been returned.My car is a 1999 BMW, 328i, which I bought in Nov. 2016, from a party I have known since the 1980's, who bought the car w/less than 20K miles, and had maintenance records, so I knew what I was getting; and, I've sunk a substantial amount of money restoring it… but, because of its age, it's being totaled by the insurance company; and, I'm looking at a $6,500 hit, at minimum. Moreover, if I elect to take the car and fix it, I can no longer insure it for collision or comprehensive. The insurance company says they have contacted Uber, but it might take 8 weeks to get them to respond, which, as of July 8th, Uber has not done.In this regard, one would think that Uber would bend over backwards to help identify the driver and his car, not just for my sake; but, for the sake of future passengers. I say this because I'm aware that the Uber app. will show what drivers are in any particular area at any given time; and, that the drivers tend to circulate in a general area. Moreover, one would think that the passenger would have filed a report with Uber, and they would be happy to get involved in resolving this matter, which involved no injuries, and damages of about $4K to repair my vehicle.",1.0,0

"I was a 4.9 rated driver with over 450 trips. Vehicle depreciation, being contractor, dealing with ungrateful/cheap passengers, and fuel expenses were ok to deal with until Uber spent money and lobbied to have warrant checks and fingerprinting eliminated as employment requirement in Houston. Now the market is flooded with druggies, perverts, and criminals. Uber rather have thousands of sub-par drivers than reward good drivers. This keeps the surge down and in theory more people will use the service if the prices aren't surging.I had a repeat customer tell me she has had 2 bad experiences with Uber since the regulations were lifted (Uber only spends money on upper management and tech gurus whose sole purpose is to cheat drivers and lie to regulators). Her first negative experience was with a female driver who had her boyfriend in the car with her during the pickup and had just smoked weed because the car reeked of it. Her other experience was coming home from her birthday and a male driver had clutter in the backseat, so she had to sit in the front.He kept turning on the dome light and making advances through perverted comments about how good her feet, toes, and legs looked. Also, Uber records a driver's every move (they send daily driving reports-braking, acceleration, and speeding). But they don't include these objective/measurable statistics in the driver rating. That is purely subjective and left to the passenger's opinion about the driver. So a drunk cannot like the way you look and give a cowardly 1 star rating because of that. A drunk can type in the wrong pickup address and then give a 1 star, claiming the driver needs to improve pickups. And Uber doesn't reward the drivers who provide excellent service despite the way the system is rigged to USE DRIVERS.",1.0,0

After purchasing my Uber gift card with 50 dollars cash (because my credit card is unavailable for use at this time) I proceeded to scratch off the covering of the code so I would be able to immediately redeem it, apply it to my account. Only when I did the numbers were unreadable, illegible, and part of the gift card paper had come off. There is no way at all for me to be able to read anything under that, it is beyond disgusting and despicable. If Uber would print its gift cards on plastic instead of paper the code could and would stay much more intact to be readable upon scratch-off. Yes, this may cost a little more but money is all that matters, right? There is no way to void a gift card once it has been activated, so I am stuck with this useless piece of paper I had just paid 50 dollars for. I panicked and begged for help at the store and there was nothing they could do to help me.There is no customer service helpline to call for help or anything. All one can do is send messages or emails and wait hoping for a resolution to their problem or issue. I did this many, many times and without any success at all, it has been a horrible experience for me. Each response I receive simply copied and pasted the exact same words on their app and website (which of course I already know). I needed help not insensitive robot replies.After more than 24 hours of email tag and haggling and no resolution in addition to calling Uber's critical accident, safety report line, here I am filing my complaint. I have been severely sunburned by the extreme summer heat and unable to make it to the clinic, the pharmacy, and a friend's house. Uber has chosen to sacrifice integrity, personable , and any immediate assistance or squalor quality of cheap paper instead of durable plastic in the name of profits and cost-cutting, and it has soured much faith I had in this company. My issue still remains unresolved.Desired outcome: I want the 50 gift card which I paid for applied to my account, plus an additional 50 extra in rider credits applied to my account for my pain and suffering due to no way provided by this business (Uber) to seem immediate resolution to issues such as this. Of course providing a helpline for customers to call or printing their gift cards on plastic instead of paper will probably never happen. However we all know that it should. I am very angry.",1.0,0
"I was waiting in a long line for a bus to get to Greek Theater from satellite parking. Several people started calling UBER. So did I. Was texted that driver was on way. Never shows. Then received text that he was unavailable, so another being sent. At that point I replied to Cancel, as we had made the bus. Charges were later sent to me. I tried to dispute, but was told that the ride was complete. I replied that someone must have taken the ride, as I had cancelled. They would not refund.",1.0,0
I use to use Uber all the time until this past week I purchased a car. After I got my car I received several charges from Uber on my account. I immediately informed Uber who advised me it was indeed on another customer's account. However they have done NOTHING to try and rectify this issue. They have the worst communication system possible. No one has responded in two days and they didn't even refund me!! I will also be putting this review on BBB. UBER IS A BUNCH OF SCAM ARTISTS AND I'LL NEVER USE THEIR SERVICE AGAIN.,1.0,0
My 13 year old child was able to independently create an account and be provided services. It is against the law and supposedly the company rules of service unaccompanied minors. This happened in the past with my daughter. It is scary for me as a mom and hope the company will modify their registration process to ensure that clients are 18 and over or have parental consent to waive that requirement. So sad.,1.0,0
"I had been a customer for over 2+ years without one complaint or bad review on Uber. While traveling in Mexico I had an extremely awful experience with another customer on Uber Share to the point that the woman was irate and offending me, but Uber decided to cancel my service without even once hearing my side of the story!!!! I contact them numerous times via email until after the 3rd attempt I finally received a pathetic email stating I am no longer a customer. They stated they opened an investigation, but yet will not share any information! If this is how they treat their customers, I definitely prefer to utilize Lyft. User beware of Uber and their horrible customer service. Don't expect them to even hear your side of the story! No wonder they are plastered negatively all over the news for good reason!",1.0,0
"My husband and I were visiting New York City. We used the Metro and buses most of the trip, but we were going to Carnegie Hall for a concert in the rain. We didn't want to get wet, so we requested an Uber for the first time. We waited where we were told, on the sidewalk, in the rain, with time to spare. When the Uber driver texted that he was there, we didn't see his car at all. We tried waving at people, but we didn't see them and no one stopped. Then, the drive was cancelled by the driver. So, we waited another at least ten minutes for another driver, which ended up getting us there. The next day, I was emailed that we were charged a $5 cancellation fee for the first ride we never took. My big problem is that when I contacted Uber, they did not understand and didn't do anything to fix it. I did not cancel the ride, and we were standing where we we're supposed to. I won't be using Uber again.",1.0,0
Totally unprofessional driver - First when he did not pull up to location he waited across the street from the location. So my son and I had to walk across. NO problem. When we get to destination my hotel was across the street I asked him to make a U-turn and drop me in front of my location. He told me he wanted to go straight so he wasn't making U-turn. He said he would have to go around the block. I said fine with me. I told him I was going to report him. He then sped up the car to the middle of next block and told me and my child to get out and I did leave without incident.Logged into Uber and reported him. The problem I log into my Uber account and see a charge for $75. I reach out to Uber and they tell me it's because of clean up. If only you can see my face the driver had the nerve to submit pictures of some water on the seats that I did not do. Unacceptable. This driver is a fraud. He needs to be penalized for his actions. I have a witness to my account. He needs to provide a time stamp for pictures he submitted because he is a fraud. And the fact that I was charged additional $75 because I wasn't happy with my services is absurd.,1.0,0
"On June 11, 2017, my wife and I attended a Dave Matthews concert in Chicago. Afterward, we were directed by staff security to walk to Michigan Ave. adjacent to the Museum/Aquarium/Planetarium campus to acquire a ride back to our condo as only vehicles leaving the campus would be allowed on the campus roadways. We called for an Uber at 11:06 pm and it was confirmed. We were standing in front of a condo called 1130 - address 1130 S. Michigan Ave. The Uber confirmation indicated our pickup spot would be 1131 S. Michigan Ave. Since there is only a park/greenspace opposite 1130 S. Michigan Ave. we figured the pickup address meant...We had to cross the street! Not an easy thing to do -- Michigan Ave. is 8 lanes wide and BUSY, as you can imagine after a concert with 30,000+ people.We navigated our way across the street and began to watch my phone as our driver approached for the pickup. When he was a block away - as near as I could tell from the ap - his car disappeared from my ap display and I was notified my ride was cancelled. Great! So, we called for another Uber driver from our new position across the street from the 1130 condo. This time the driver called me to tell me he was parked across the street - WONDERFUL! - in front of 1130 S. Michigan Ave. We had to cross Michigan Ave. again. Back to where we originally started. That driver was delightful. When I checked my credit card ap to view the evening's charges, there was a $5 fee posted. I contacted Uber via email and was informed it was a cancellation fee! I didn't cancel - Uber DID! They should be paying ME the $5 for the inconvenience. They agreed to credit my Uber account $5, which I really didn't appreciate. I may never use Uber again. They maintained that company policy prohibited them from refunding me the $5. I protested to no avail and was told the case was closed.In addition to this SNAFU, each ride I summoned from Uber was for a pool driver to help defray the cost of the trip. We made three trip in all using Uber on June 11. We had to pay full fare for each trip. Apparently, there were no other riders in the vicinity that evening? Not likely! There were 6 festivals in town and the concert patrons made the evening a lucrative one for the drivers. There was a swarm of people out and about around Chicago this night. I was told by one of our driver that due to the number of drivers being called the rates were increased from normal.My fares were doubled or tripled for the short drives I called for - which is why I called for Uber pool drivers. I'm all for making a quick buck, but since there were so many people needing rides, Uber pools should have been available when called for. It was a classic ""Bait and Switch"" operation, in my opinion. Travel at your own risk, people! There's a reason why Uber is always in the news!",2.0,0
"I placed an order on Uber Eats app. Less than a second after I placed the order I noticed I had order 3 subs instead of one and I wanted to remove two of those subs and keep only one along with the other stuff I had also ordered. When I call customer service they are telling me that nothing can be changed or canceled because the order was already prepared. In less than a minute from placing the order and calling they had prepared the sub. Yeah right. So pretty much I'm forced to pay for 2 subs I didn't want. And in the Uber app it gives option to cancel or change your order but when you call they tell you no you can't, so I see it as false advertising.",1.0,0
"Uber has a program called Ride Pass that they have rolled out to a lot of Philadelphians. In exchange of a $20 fee, the user would receive UberPool rides at a flat fee of $2.99 and UberX rides at a flat rate of $5.99 within a designated area for a total of 28 days. The only stipulation, is that if the full value of the ride exceeds $20, the rider must pay the overage. (i.e. if a pool ride costs $24, the user would be charged $6.99). Easy right?I live and work within the designated area, so I was elated to have this opportunity. The trouble started this week. On Tuesday, the ride that I requested had an overage. I take Uber into work, and it rarely goes over $20, so I checked another account that does not have the Rider Pass and lo and behold, the full fare price was under $20. I emailed customer service and they refunded me the difference on two separate occasions admitting it was a system error & that it would be fixed. Yesterday, I emailed them and got a sorry-the overage charges are correct. Today, after providing them with proof that the full fare ride was under $20, and they are intentionally inflating the UberPool prices for their Ride Pass customers, they deleted my account.I have asked them on numerous occasions for a phone number, but their answers are always cut & paste. I don't really know who to go to for this. It is not the money, I mean, it's literally a $20 fee and under $10 in overages. But it's the principle. People should know that Uber is intentionally offering this program, but then jacks up the costs & it is not fair. I would not have know if I didn't have access to two accounts.",1.0,0
"I purchased an Uber Smart Pass a week ago and I've noticed several lies within their promotion. When I first purchased it, the app told me that anything under $30 would be covered within the Smart Pass range. Now that verbiage has changed to $20. Also, since purchasing the Smart Pass, Uber drivers have been canceling rides left and right. I've had drivers arrive AT MY APT. and cancel the ride for no real reason. The most annoying part is being charged $5 each time. I can't comprehend why the service charges YOU whenever the driver cancels. That's insane. Charge the drivers for being inept or money hungry for a ""better ride"". Don't punished your loyal customers.I was scammed last week when a ride to Brooklyn was supposed to be $15 under the Smart Pass. I received the receipt and it was over $35! When I contacted Uber, they gave me the runaround and said it was merely an estimate. I told them that was ** because I had a screenshot of the ride. It wasn't an estimate. They refused to refund me the $15. Uber is a joke. Once this Smart Pass has expired, I'm deleting the app.",2.0,0
"I wrote to Uber, ""Your previous drunk driver crashes the car far away from my destination and you still charge me. He leaves me in the middle of nowhere. And again I have to pay more for another Uber which is more far away from my destination and you again charge me for that ride. I kindly ask you refund everything in the scenario where you would have killed someone.""I can't believe after all this they still charge me and would not refund. Uber does not care whether you live or die, you have to just pay their fare. They employ people who drives drunk crashing car in the middle of night and if you turned out alive after that they will leave by the side of road and still charge for that ride. And you wait another half hour to get to another Uber with no option and pay another fare hoping to reach alive and out of all this Uber says our partners tend to have high standards.",1.0,0

"Uber mentions standard upfront charges for their pool rides but if the person you are pooling with cancels the ride, Uber will introduce dynamic charges and charge that extra amount to you. And i guess they even charge the person who cancels. So in a way Uber is making 2 way money. They charged me 3 times the normal charge for a ride where another pooler cancelled the ride. And now they are fooling me saying that since the distance travelled was more than what was entered originally they are charging me more. But actually distance increased because the driver had to pick up another pooler. Now this person didn't turn up. So entire money load comes on me.",1.0,0

I have tried contacting Uber to resolve this problem - there is no phone number and the given email address does not accept incoming messages. The only way to contact them is to fill in a contact form on their website and hope they call. Since it references my email address, which according to their website is not acknowledged as belonging to my account, I don't know if I will hear from them. I had the double authentication on my account, which is supposed to be highest form of security one can get from Uber.

I am a driver for Uber and noticed I am getting shorted on my pay. I was sent 5 miles to get a rider for a 2 mile ride. Made $2.74. Uber charged the rider $5.96.  Uber took $2.30 for themselves then gave me 75% which made my real pay 46%. Uber cheats their drivers.

"I arrived at the train station and since I missed the bus and now it take 40 mins before another one to come, try to request an Uber. My phone died and shuts down while it was searching for a driver. I assumed that deleted the transaction because the phone was completely dead and off. I decided to walk home. This walk is 30 mins from the train station with some area with no sidewalks. I make a stop at the store half way home. I get home plug up my phone, check the email and see a receipt from Uber. They charged me for the ride as if the driver reported that he picked me up and dropped me to my destination which didn't happened. I walked 30 mins to my front door. I filed a complaint and their response was after review of your account we believe you made this trip. I expressed again that I didn't make the trip because I've use them all the time why one time I'm just going to file a complaint for $6.30. They said again they cannot refund my money and maybe a family used my account. I expressed that I don't have family here, I stopped in a store and have a receipt during the time the driver claims he dropped me off. It's the principle of the matter. How do you report that you drop someone off that never got into your vehicle that didn't even know you were coming. I would've preferred a ride home versus walking for 30 mins. So I got charged for a ride that never happened and had to walk home after a long day in the office. Uber really need better customer service skills. I will never use them again.",1.0,0

I say that it is supposed because I was charged for all 5 transactions and the money has been taken out from my bank account and paid for. I have been emailing back and forth to Uber about this, but every time it is always someone different replying to me and it is as though they do not even read the previous replies. All they keep telling me is that the charges are legitimate. The first time they told me it is legitimate, then I relied and told them that I was charged and I have my bank statement to prove it, then the next person tells me that it looks as though the charges were disputed and refunded to me, then the next person tells me the charges are legitimate and does not read the previous emails. After, a long time, I finally get someone that said the money was refunded in April and asked me to send my April bank statement, which I did, but then they tell me it looks like in the system it shows it was refunded in May and to send the May statement which I then did, and now the reply to me again is that it looks like the charges are legitimate. This is really ridiculous because no one seems to be able to understand that I was charged and never refunded any money.

"First, my complaint is Uber REFUSES to call anyone so you can have a conversation about your dissatisfaction. Second my complaint is that they are running a bait and switch that is unethical. My TRIP: THE ISSUE is that their app told me I could USE UberX for a trip from the Indianapolis airport to my house in Cincinnati and the fee would be $115. I checked it 3 different time during the week to confirm the rate wasn't a error. When I got to the Indy airport from FL I checked it again and the app said my cost would be $115. WHEN the driver showed up tells me that I can't use UberX but had to select UberXL because of the distance of the trip.If that was the case then their app should have alerted me FROM THE BEGINNING that I could only use UberXL for that distance. If it would have said that THEN I would have rented a car for $90 instead of having to pay $235. At that time I had no choice because I had to be back in Cincinnati at 3pm. Therefore, my only choice was to follow the driver's instruction to ACCEPT the ride with UberX for a short ride (which I did) and then resubmit the request under UberXL again which I did. Instead of the fare being $115 it ended up being $235. AND... it seems no one at Uber can understand my frustration and NO ONE is willing to have a conversation with me, which is absolutely ludicrous! They know that if I would have thought the ride would cost $235 I (or any other logical person) would have rented a car and they would have lost the fare. Complete bait and switch!",1.0,0
My name is Scott and my husband was working for Uber. He had a ride with 3 people in it. When they got in they had a metal smoking pipe that they put out on the hood liner of my car. The pipe was left in the car and a burn hole in my car. He sent pictures to Uber and they said that they needed a quote. So the first quote we got was almost $2000 from Chrysler since that's my car. We only received the quote over the phone. It was too far away to drive so we called Chrysler near us. They referred us to a person that gave us a quote of about $300. He sent the quote to Uber and they got back to him today.The insurance company called him and said that it was a $1000 deductible. So the amount had to be over 1000. We had sent them the $300 and they said they were not paying for it. He contacted Uber again and they messaged him back telling him that they tried to charge the rider but the rider has to agree to it. Of course they did not want to pay it. They said that the insurance company has the final decision. Now I'm left with a burn mark from an Uber rider and nothing is going to be done. Uber is the worst company to work for. They even just cut the pay on all their drivers. The pay is not worth the damage. Thanks Uber for ruining my car. Lyft is way better.,1.0,0

"I am wondering if all the Uber drivers are given the ability to actually fire clients... making it so that they and their families can no longer use the Uber service and on top of that... rob that person of $50? There were 2 cancellations on this evening both by the same driver in the same hour. On this night my 18 year old son (who had struggled from kidney failure since birth and whose growth was somewhat stunted) was hanging out with friend at the ""sci fi factory"" near Keller TX was ready to walk the 1.5 miles home when I told him just to wait and I'd get him an Uber. The Uber driver pulled up... took one look at my son and screamed ""you have to be 18 to ride!"" Then he pulled away leaving my son standing there. Never asked for ID... never even gave me a call! My son informed me of the situation... I immediately set a ride to take me from my home 1.5 miles down the road. Again that ride went to the same driver who then cancelled it as well. So I had to reschedule a ride to my son in order to ride with this 18 year old 1.5 miles down the street. The next day my Uber account was shut down with a $50 gift card attached and shortly after that my mom who was linked thru the family Uber program also reported her account to have been shut down. I loved the Uber program up until this. I have written several complaints requesting just my $50 from the gift card be returned and my request has been ignored. No one has ever asked me what happened... This driver simply concluded my son was less than his 18 years and I was immediately convicted and punished for an error in his judgement. It is now my goal to spread the word about the customer service I was shown and hope it doesn't happen to anyone else.",1.0,0

"I just want to highlight the inconvenience that has been provided by your company app to my friend: Apoorva **, her account has been blocked since a week now and we both have been trying to get in touch with your company via email and all we get in reply is that your system raised a flag and blocked us. Lol. ""FLAG just because we were updating email address."" And you want us to also ""Appreciate your understanding in this regard."" - LOL. We have all our invoices blocked in that account. Hence it's a request if someone with some logical sense can have a look at her account and get it sorted for her. Systems can do errors, but who accepts their mistakes these days. All we want is our invoices and we will make sure never to bother Uber again for any ride. Ola is way more better with respect to quality app. Last thing I remember when the account was working that we were updating email address to get invoice on email and yours mathematically correct systems blocked us down just because we were updating our email. Really Great Coding And Super AI. Finally a person from your company updated our email address but when I tried to log in I noticed that the flag was never removed.If by any chance you find that we are real and her account is real and if she is real and if anyone from Uber can read and understand about what we are trying to say then please go ahead and email us all the invoices: **, or remove the wrong flag raised by your super system Generation 6 so that we can download it manually. Attached image shows that we are suspended and Uber can't even share the reason for the same - Because email team may have some procedures and rules which they have to follow blindly, to which I think that the rules have been made by a mentally blind person.

"I use my corporate card for business trips when I use Uber. My company told me I have a charge for $3.80 that I need to show proof for so I went to my Uber app and seen that I never took a trip on that date. I reached out to Uber and explained to them that I was charged but never took a ride. The first response was someone telling me to send my bank statement and they will be happy to reverse the charges. I asked my job to provide proof as I don't get statements because it's my corporate cards.I sent a PDF with the proof and was told they are not able to make fare adjustments to trips that were completed 30 days or more ago. I explained to them that I was just informed by my job that I had this outstanding charge on my card and had I known about this charge sooner, I would have been reached out. Then I get a message saying they have not been able to locate the charge, to send the posted date, transaction description, amount and type of account. I had already sent the PDF with this information, but gave the information again. Then I received another message saying they are not able to make fare adjustments to trips that were completed 30 days or more ago.I also asked, ""How can I make a fraudulent claim,"" and I received the same message and they closed my ticket out. I responded for a manager to call me and I have not received a response and it's been more than 3 days. I'm frustrated with Uber that I have to reimburse my job $3.80 for a ride I did not take and Uber can't even locate that they charged me. $3.80 is not a lot of money but it is the principle that Uber should have done right and refunded the charge instead of sending generic messages.

"I am an Uber driver. I want to comment. I try not to cancel. I have had plenty of riders when I show up at their destination are not ready. I usually call them after 5 minutes, most of the time they are on their way and I wait. I have had some whose phone goes to voice mail and I waited a few more minutes they come or they don't so I cancel. Uber drivers do not get paid if they wait after 5 min and the rider cancels which has happened to me, which pissed me off, especially when it is a long trip. Riders need to be outside on time or call the Uber driver. I have never canceled due to a destination, but better yet, who wants to maybe drive as I did a long distance and upon arriving have the rider cancel and don't get paid. No excuse.",3.0,1

"My family recently visited NYC and my dad has had great luck using Uber in other cities in the past, so when we couldn't get a cab easily, we took Uber quite a few times over our 3 day trip. Some trips were great, some were just okay, but one of them was beyond bad. We were traveling from near Times Square to Battery Park (we had reservations to be on Ellis Island at a specific time). We selected Battery Park as our drop off point, and told it to our driver again when we got in the car (the dirty, smelly car).None of us are from New York, but even we know that Battery Park is at the bottom of Manhattan, I mean really it's not some obscure location. We realized we were getting close, and then for some reason, we were going through a tunnel. When my dad tried to ask the driver why we were going through a tunnel, he couldn't really answer the question, because he spoke literally no English. I'm super glad that Uber is open to hiring all cultures and everything, but I do think that drivers should speak enough English to communicate with passengers about their route and destination.As we emerged from the tunnel a few minutes later, it turns out we were in Brooklyn. Now again, I'm not from NYC, but I 100% know that Brooklyn is NOT on the way to Battery Park from Times Square. As we tried to explain to the driver that we were clearly in the wrong place, he was still so confused. Eventually, we had to pull up our own GPS and attempt to get him to the right place. We ended up having to get out a few blocks from Battery Park and run to the ferry to try to make our reservations. We ended up missing any time on Liberty Island, simply because this driver had absolutely no idea what he was doing. To add insult to injury, while we were on the ferry, my dad received an email of a fare adjustment because there were tolls on the tunnel (about $10).When we contacted Uber, after quite a few messages they finally agreed to refund just about half of the fare (half of the total that included the completely unnecessary toll charges). This driver made a completely incomprehensible mistake, ruined part of our vacation, and to be honest, it was a little scary when we knew we were in a stranger's car heading somewhere unknown. I think that if Uber is going to send completely unprepared and irresponsible drivers out in their name, they need to stand behind that and offer full refunds for experiences as bad as this.",1.0,0

"I am very frustrated with Uber. 2 days I missed my bus because of Uber and their foolishness beyond my control and I want my money back. I am dissatisfied with not being able to talk to 1 person instead of 3 and 4 different people by email through the Uber app. Ridiculous!!!! This all started last Friday 5/5, I requested Uber at 6:28, my Uber took a few min. but Pineda came at a reasonable time. My stop is 5-6 min. from my house but the stupid Uber app told the driver to go in the opposite direction to get the other rider 15 min away and therefore made me miss my 7 am bus. So I then had to take another Uber because the next bus was 7:35 and that would have made me even later for work. Not only that but I have taken this ride several times and it cost $6, why was I charged $9.30. The receipt even says $6.26. So now I have to request another Uber to get me to the train. That was another charge but it looks like they took care of that one from Friday. So today's 5/10 events were even better. I started requesting the Uber at 6.30 am so, 2 Ubers cancelled on me back to back. The 3rd Uber request went in but the the app said he cancelled. So I tried getting another driver but the 3rd driver ended showing up but of course by then I miss the 7 am bus again, so I had to request a 4th uber to the train station to get to work once again late! I want those fares credited for the inconvenience you Ubers have caused. $5.14 and $4.85 are the 2 fares I had to take and get the train on time. My boss is threatening demotion if I am late again this week!!!! Customer service/support does not work and the in-app help sucks. I had to send a message on each charge in question and now have several different people in several conversations. RIDICULOUS!!!!This is frustrating and no way to deal with customer issues. Where is the customer support??? I wanted to speak with some immediately but I have to go through all of this red tape and drama. ** and still no one from Uber has called. I messengered them on Facebook and once again they tell me to go through the app and open every fare in question and tell them my dilemma for each incident! UGH!!! RIDICULOUS.",1.0,0
"I decided to try Uber Express Pool after work because of its advertised lower fares. I scheduled for an Uber Express Pool on Monday at 4:56 pm - 5:01 pm with a fare for $3.75, which is pretty decent. I had no issues. Because it went so well, I decided to schedule an Uber Express Pool again after work on Tuesday for the same time, 4:56 pm - 5:01 pm. Surprisingly, it was the same price, $3.75. When I finally got dropped off home, I received an email receipt saying I was charged $20.61 for surge pricing, booking fee, the distance and time it took to drop me off. This is absolutely ridiculous as I had no prior consent or knowledge that this would happen. I tried talking to Uber Support about this issue and demanded compensation for their shady marketing but all they kept saying was ""surge pricing"" occurred in the area and there was ""higher demand"" around the time of my pick up. IF I was notified prior to the driver arriving, I probably would've canceled because getting Uber Pool would have been significantly cheaper than the bullcrap they just pulled off here. I am highly dissatisfied with how this went down and the lack of explanation from Uber Support. I will NOT be using Uber ever again in fear they will over charge me again.",1.0,0
"I have had a few issues with Uber in the past few weeks and overall, I am disappointed because I feel that my time and money are valuable and this is not being respected by Uber. The most recent issue was yesterday, when I ordered UberPool, however was charged an UberX fee. If you look at my past ride history, I am well aware of how to order Pool vs UberX. The same thing happened to me on 5/1 (UberX instead of Pool), however I believed it was my mistake and did not say anything. Yesterday, however I was very careful. The difference between Pool and UberX is significant and I am frustrated that I have paid so much extra, for no fault of my own. What is worse is that when I wrote to Uber Support, I was given a generic reply where they had not even attempted to fill in the automated blanks, and they would not respond to my messages.Secondly, last week, I wrote to Uber as my driver asked me to walk 10 minutes for the pickup point. I had a lot of groceries and requested Uber so that I would not have to walk. I was not impressed, and my co-passenger in UberPool was annoyed at me because it took me 10 minutes to walk to the car. It was not my fault! I had put in the correct pickup address. I had ordered UberXL 4/22, I believe. At the time I ordered it, the ETA for pick up was ~ 4 minutes. However, the driver made a wrong turn, and it added 20 minutes to the pickup time. By the time I wanted to cancel, it was past 5 minutes and I did not want to be charged a cancellation fee. I felt that the driver was also unprofessional and did not answer my 2 attempts at contacting him. Once again, Uber Support blamed me and did not even try to acknowledge my concern until the following day - I am sure you will be able to find the thread.I use Uber and Lyft frequently as it is my primary mode of transportation. I have not faced any issues with Lyft in the past. I like Uber because the app and algorithm seem better, however, based on my experiences, I know feel it is safer for me to use Lyft moving forward because I am frustrated that I am losing money and time with Uber. Lastly, I have been on the ""List"" to be notified when Flat Fares are released. Both times, the option has NOT been available to me, and my boyfriend can buy passes. When I contacted Uber, they simply replied that the passes sold out (Not true as my boyfriend could still purchase them), and then Uber told me it's not available to every Rider. Seems discriminatory.",1.0,0

"I ordered a ride to get to work, the ETA said 15 minutes. The driver showed up in 8, and while usually that would be seen as a positive thing, I was not ready to leave yet since I thought I had 7 more minutes. Uber has a feature where the driver cancel the trip 5 minutes after arriving at the destination and it automatically charges the customer $5 even though no service was provided. This happened to me all within the 15 minute time frame I originally agreed upon with the initial Uber request. It's only $5, but it's a matter of principle. On top of this, their customer service is nearly non-existent as they don't even have a phone number to discuss this with anyone. You can only correspond through email which is very impersonal and a massive hassle. I cannot believe how shady they came across with this. I will personally never use Uber again and will do my best to make sure everyone I know goes to their competitors like Lyft and steals profits from them.

"I'm informing you of some issues that are occurring while using these services. My girlfriend uses uber 5 days out of the week to go to both her school and her work each day. However, we have noticed more lately that the uber drivers keep canceling the rides. It will say they are arriving in 13 mins or however far they are then when they get close they cancel the ride so we request another trip but no 1 is available or it takes up to 15 or sometimes 20 mins to even get another person to accept the request.So in these cases she has been late to both work and school several times due to the cancellations of the uber drivers. So we have had to resort in getting lyft instead. I understand that sometimes things come up which might cause a cancellation however when you're working for a business where you're getting paid to provide a service such as transportation to people then I don't believe having multiple people multiple times cancel on you looks so good for the company. Word of mouth goes a long way.Maybe there is a way the company can prevent the drivers from canceling or make it something that they have to come out of pocket a couple dollars to make up for the cancellation to encourage the drivers to not cancel. Simply because if people such as my girlfriend and I rely on uber as a means of transportation that is being used daily and I know many more do the same and if they are having the same issues it doesn't look it nor does it help either side ours or yalls drivers. If people go somewhere else for transportation then Uber loses out on money which means they wont have the money to provide people with jobs. So uber needs to step their game up. Start by making it not a convenient thing for the drivers. If they sign up for a job and accept the drive then backing out of it should not be an option.",2.0,0

"I was picked up for a ride to the Atlanta airport on 4/27/17 in what was supposed to be an UberX. Uber's stated standards for an UberX are a 4-seater car. But I had to ride in the FRONT SEAT of a teeny-tiny, red 2-seater. I had to hold my luggage on my lap because it was so small. And worst of all, it was driven by somehow who didnt know how to operate the GPS. He said, ""Sorry I dont know how to use the updated system."" For more than half the ride, the GPS kept trying to redirect us back to my house (the starting point). I was having to try to figure out how to operate the system for him. Which is not what I paid for! It was incredibly stressful.More than halfway through the ride, he realized that he hadn't properly started my ride. So I can't even be sure how the final rate was determined. It said it was a 14-mile ride, but I live 11 from the airport. I contacted Uber promptly about the experience and received an e-mail marked that it was resolved. However nothing was resolved. I was not issued a refund. When I followed up after my trip, they asked me to state why the driver's vehicle didn't match the app description.How would I know that? Don't they vet their drivers? They should have just issued a refund immediately. I've disputed the charge with my credit card company and filed a BBB complaint, because I don't plan to be treated poorly. I've had some scary experiences with bad Uber drivers, but this is my last. It's not worth jeopardizing my safety or sanity to save on a cab ride.

"I just wanted to know why Customer Rating is displayed on Uber app... What it is related to... So based on this rating, do drivers have authority to cancel our booking??

From my point of view, customer should have a chance to rate a driver as it can be useful for other customers while selecting a cab...

So in this case, as how Uber drivers will be asking us to give rating of 5, we should also ask them to give rating of 5... So do I mean it correct?? For this only reason, I uninstalled Uber app and I am not using this app... As per my understanding/view, drivers may give rating but it should be confidential to company data only. It should not be displayed to customer/to any driver... If at all in any case, customer is very aggressive and so, based on his rating given by the driver, the company should have the right to block him on booking a ride...",1.0,0
"So I am away in Vegas and I called an Uber for my daughter in Los Angeles to pick her up at school and take her home. I've done this tons of times with Uber. The school 10 minutes or 3 miles away. It is straight down the street. So I see a charge for 12 dollars and I look and I see the Uber driver picked up my daughter, drove past my house and took her 20 minutes out of the way and then took her back home. So I say that has to be a mistake. I dispute it. No way a 10 minutes ride is more than 10 dollars and I picked a Uberpool so no more than 6. The driver picks up a second person DOWN THE STREET FROM MY HOUSE and goes and gets on the freeway. My daughter let him know he's going in the wrong direction and he still take the second person home and then bring her back. Making a 10 minute ride 30 minutes.So the first dispute I get this: ""Thanks for reaching out. We reviewed your trip and it was already adjusted to the estimate to account for the route taken. We're sending you an updated receipt so you can see the adjustment that took place. Refunds generally take between 3-5 business days. Let us know if you have questions.""That brought my total down to 8 dollars. So I wasn't happy with that. I let them know there's no way I am overpaying for a mistake on their part. Because who does that. Overcharge the customer to make sure they still make a profit. Because their driver messed up clearly. This is the second response: ""Your driver let us know that the trip recorded incorrect pickup and drop-off points. With that in mind, we adjusted this fare to reflect the actual trip so your driver could be compensated for the full service they provided you. If you have more information to provide us about this trip, please feel free to let us know so we can help. Thank you!""So I said I didn't send incorrect pickup or drop-off locations because I have never had a problem with this before. I had called Uber from my phone to pick up my daughter when I am not with her many times more than 20 times I'm sure. I've used their flat rates and brought 40 trips a month at least. So now all of a sudden my location was off.Nope wasn't having it so this is the last response from Uber: ""Your uberPOOL fare for any destination is set when you request pickup. Fares for other vehicle options like uberX and UberBLACK are calculated after you arrive at your destination. With uberPOOL, you'll always know your guaranteed fare before you ride. In this case, we are able to make an adjustment to your fare. You will receive an updated receipt with your new fare breakdown. Moving forward, please use the correct destination when requesting a pickup in order to see an accurate upfront fare and help us match you with riders heading in the same direction. We appreciate your understanding. Thanks for getting in touch.""So after this I told them, “Thank you for getting the price correct.” and I will never use their services again. Because this not the first time this has happened. And for them to tell me to make sure I was right on locations when is the last 6 months I have never had a problem before. But what they should have said was, “Our driver made a mistake. Here is a refund for the overpayment and have a nice day.” But I thanked them for their service but I will not be using them ever again.",1.0,0
"Multiple experiences with Uber India via email has convinced me that their staff's competence, training level provided to them by Uber India and their internal group who frames processes for non US countries SUCK BIG TIME.

"I drove for Uber for about 4 months in Tucson. Riders are a bunch of crybabies who will leave a 1 star review if you don't let them drink their coffee in your car. Uber has fostered this mentality with its feedback system giving the rider a disproportionate amount of power. It was common for a rider to be disrespectful or abusive. Riders Never tip. Getting paid 95 cents per mile is nothing for what you put up with: traffic congestion, unreasonable riders, canceled rides, wear and tear on your vehicle, increased insurance rates, long waits at the airport, drunk riders, etc. Go to Uber's website and you will find no mention of the expenses involved with using your vehicle in ridesharing--mainly maintenance and depreciation. YOU ARE NOT BEING COMPENSATED FOR THIS. AND UBER DOESN'T WANT DRIVERS TO KNOW THIS. This is the dirty little secret in the rideshare business. There's a reason why 50% of drivers are no longer with Uber after 6 months. ANY job is better than ridesharing.",1.0,0

"I had requested a pickup and app showed 3 minutes, then 6 minutes, then 7 minutes so I cancelled and decided to get the bus. While waiting at the bus stop about 5 blocks away, the driver called and said he was there. I told him I left but he asked me to wait for a couple of minutes. Despite the fact that the bus was only 5 blocks away, he couldn't find me. My dumb decision as I let two buses pass by and as the 3rd bus arrived, my driver pulled up and told me he found me because of the passenger in the car. The first thing was that the driver was new, ok no problem, but the car had the overwhelming smell of flowers that you couldn't breathe. Then he took me on a circuitous that resulted in me being trapped in downtown traffic the complete opposite of my direction. After watching another two pickups get dropped off before me, I got out of the car in the middle of traffic at a stoplight. Given where I was, I jumped on the underground and made my way home and can guarantee that I made it home faster than the Uber would have got me there.

This time I was overcharged by more than $12 dollars. Uber claims I changed my destination on the return trip to my home. Obviously the driver neglected to report I had reached my destination before he continued to his next location so I was charged for those miles. Uber refuses to acknowledge the error and after numerous emails only respond with the same canned response. They won't even check with the driver or my trip history. And no phone number to speak with a live person. They don't care about their customers. I am switching to a different company.,1.0,0
"After using Uber (linked to Paypal), my Uber account was hacked. I received a text message in a Russian language. If I'm in Florida, how can I be using Uber in Russia? Hello. Next two large charges appeared on Paypal. Paypal immediately rectified the situation and imagine that they actually provide a phone number where you can call them! Uber. No. The hacker changed the name on my account and password so I can't log in. I've made 10 attempts to get this fixed - to no avail. Uber won't let you talk to anyone. And if you can't log in, you're hosed. My credentials have been compromised and they could care less. I can't even cancel the account. UBER BEWARE. What a scam operation. Guess my next steps will be an attorney.",1.0,0
"I requested a ride via Uber last week while I was at the San Diego Padres stadium with my kids. The driver assigned to me claimed erroneously that ""roads are closed"" and simply gave up. Roads were not closed. No attempt to establish a separate meeting place. I suspect they got a better offer on another ride and ditched us. Took a real taxi cab and got to where I needed to go. I then found Uber tried to charge me $5 for the ""experience"". I disputed the charge and got that taken off my credit card. Not paying a penny for botched service. I will never bother with Uber again, period. You may pay more for a cab, but it's worth the added investment to ensure their commitment to pick you up will actually be honored and carried out professionally, unlike amateurs off the street.",1.0,0
"Recently I got charged 2 $5 cancellation fees for requesting rides I did not request. I have no idea how they got requested and Uber not only didn't help but charged me for it! The fact that I have never cancelled a trip, that the requests were 10 mins apart (odd), and the customer is always right (if you want them to return) should have been enough for them to waive these fees. But they didn't. And I couldn't get anyone on the phone only email. They kept sending the same boiler plate email that they had investigated and the fees were legit. Terrible customer service that is going to cost them money. My husband and I were using them for work and personal and have since deleted our accounts. Now using Lyft.",1.0,0

"I was charged a cancellation fee by a driver I never requested. I was already in vehicle with a driver who was completely confused because the requested Pool had him pick up 2 people from same location. I send Uber a message explaining this and they issue me a $5 credit to account. NO, I want a $5 credit back to my bank account! It may seem petty to some but I control my funds not Uber or anyone else. I explain to them I want refund to my account and their response that in accordance with their cancellation policy it can only be credited to my account, I've looked at the site and there is nothing that visibly shows cancellations are only credited to accounts. And if I'd known about this policy I would've discontinued use with Uber long time ago. The fact that a random driver can issue a cancellation and Uber automatically charges me is such a huge problem. I am officially a Lyft customer, I will dispute this with my bank and my complaints are with ConsumerAffairs, BBB and Attorney General. I have no idea who this driver is and this couldn't be possible when I was already waiting for Uber pool.",1.0,0
"While leaving Coachella festival on Sunday we were required to first go through the app and we would receive a 6 pin code to give to the driver. While he wouldn't give me his name I was able to get his license plate number California plates #**, make and model of vehicle was a jeep Cherokee. This man refused to give us a ride because we were heading to Indio and told us he would only give us a ride if we were going to Los Angeles or Orange County. This is the worst customer service as we were ready to go home and he just straight out denied us a ride because he would not make the money he wanted by giving us a ride. You guys shouldn't hire people that don't care about customer service and just deny people a ride because they simply don't think it's worth it.",1.0,0
"Me and the birthday girl my best friend and one of her friends went out to celebrate her birthday. The plan was we all pitch in for a ride there and back and since we all lived in the same direction we would just have the driver drop us off individually until he reach his destination. (Which we normally do with no problems) We dropped off the birthday girl 1st and then 5 blocks away it would be my turn, but this driver refuse to turn into my parking lot which left me no choice but to just have stop in the middle of the street to let me out. As I got out in a hurry I dropped my keys in his Van. I had my friend contact the third girl but she was too drunk to pick up.The next day I contacted the 3rd girl to get the drivers information and have her fill out a lost item report to have the driver call me back, since it was her credit card that was used for the trip. I waited 24 hours and no one called me back. I had my Acquaintance fill out another report and waited another 24 hours but no callback. I then took matters in my own hands to reach out to the support group, but they refused to help me since it was not my card that was used. They wanted me to contact my acquaintance and have her fill out a report and she would then have to deal with them.Seeing that this was my problem and hers I did not want to burden her with more of my problems. I just come to the conclusion that I will not be seeing my keys anytime soon. I wish there is a better way for the other passengers in the Uber to obtain their lost Item without involving the cardholder and making it such a difficult process. I was also very disappointed that the uber driver made me jumped out of the car in the middle of the road after I had had a few drinks and that he never called me back. Or the uber support group for not even trying to help me when I clearly had the driver’s information!",1.0,0

"I recently applied to drive for Uber. It's been weeks and I still haven't heard anything.

I know from riding Uber often and asking how the drivers like it and how did the sign up process go etc that they have hired people with expired even suspended licenses and just told them to fix it before they start, but are giving me a problem. I will not drive for them nor, will I ride with them anymore. I have been approved by Lyft in less than 24hours. I work in financial Services and have to go through extensive background checks.

Just emailing and then there are more than one person trying to help and then it get aggravating. I think they have the worst service as far as helping the drivers.

"Let's be honest, who would mind paying couple $$ for a ride and relax in the back set listening to music and not dealing with traffic, especially here in LA. But Uber won't let you enjoy this convenience as much especially recently when they changed some of their policies. Here is an example, it is late at night, you just had fun in your friend's house and it is time to request Uber to take you home. You request Uber. Wait outside for the driver. In this phase, ETA become slow. 8 minutes waiting.And two of the scenario will occur. 1- They show you that the driver is still far so you would think, ""yes let me cancel and find someone closer"" and even Uber will ask you why you had canceled and one of their reason is ""too far"" eventually. You got charged for 5$. 2- Maybe the driver is close but he would rather to cancel the ride and take ** without going all the way to pick you up. Let's say none of these situation happened. Here is how Uber would find a way to increase their charges. ""Based on the time and distance I could confirm you that this is the fare for this ride"". Uber POOL shows me 7$, after the ride 23$. Uber, to increase your revenue. Increase your profession.",3.0,1
"I have been using Uber for many years (especially as a consultant, I used them weekly for my work travel to/from airports) but was disgusted with the way the company treated me as a customer. On 4/13, I requested a pickup from LGA, Terminal C, Pickup area 1. I attempted to call the driver 5 times to let him know my exact location at Terminal C pickup area but got his voicemail each time. I waited over 15 mins just to see him drive past the requested pickup area and continue to drive through all of Terminal C (as I was trying to chase him down) without slowing down or attempting to pull into any of the subsequent pickup areas to look for me. This driver also did not attempt to contact me and proceeded to cancel my ride and charge me a $5 cancellation fee. I notified Uber of the situation and they refused to refund me my cancellation fee (would only provide an Uber credit) because it was ""not in accordance with our policy"". The fee is not the issue I had, it was the principle that I was charged for the fee. At no point was this my fault for the cancellation - the driver drove past me and did not even attempt to pick me up! After multiple attempts to contact Uber, they stopped responding to my messages. Uber is so petty that they would rather charge a fee than respect a customer who has been using their service for years. I am deleting their app and telling everyone about what a horrible service they are.",1.0,0
"Be alert for selecting UberPool for a reduced fare but being charged UberX or Economy at double the fare. When attempting to resolve, the company will state things such as 'we've adjusted a fare in the past for you' coupled with 'your fare is correct,' finally with a conclusion of 'your driver selected the trip in good faith.' I have been an Uber passenger on many occasions and never had a fare adjusted. My fare was absolutely incorrect and my driver selecting my trip is great, however, I wish to not pay a much higher fare for a type of ride I did not select.

"On 4-17-17 I signed up as a new to Uber customer. I tried to schedule a ride for the following day, but not knowing how Uber worked I inadvertently requested an Uber driver for the wrong day. When the driver profile popped up I called him and told him that I had inadvertently order the Uber ride for the wrong day, he said (the driver's name was Javier) he would cancel the ride for me. I trusted that the ride was cancelled, but to my surprise another driver was on his way to my home (David), I immediately cancelled this driver and suddenly was confronted with a popup saying I was being charged a cancellation fee of $5.00. I never ordered a second driver, so I do not know how another driver could be sent.One of the things ""I HATE"" about this system is that Uber has no way to call to speak with a customer service representative, nor do they have adequate cancellation options under their support screen. This company SUCKS!! They don't have a way to speak with ANYBODY, ANY PERSON, ANYONE!!! If this is the new millennium of how business will be done in the future it REALLY SUCKS!!! I DON'T GET IT!

"Concept of Uber is great. Try finding customer service is the pits. Once you contact them via messaging you will find that if you have an ongoing conversation, replies their system is set up to tag next available service rep.

My wife is presently texting them as I write. I'm not a patient man and have spent two three days going back and forth on a relatively simple question.

Since we did not have sufficient time to make alternate arrangements, we drove our own vehicle to the airport and paid $272 for two weeks of parking. We noticed that the Uber vehicle remained in the same position in the Dulles area while we were in route to the airport.

Visited Orlando Florida and used Uber twice to return from Universal Studio. The first day I was charged 15.88 and the second trip cost 9.34. When I questioned the first driver about the route we were taking he advised he missed his exit causing him to take the next exit which was completely out of the way. The second driver took the direct route with no problem. When I questioned Uber customer service they explained how algorithms work and found no fault with the fare. I received my receipt and noticed the total should have been 12.84. They did refund the $3 difference but refused to acknowledge the difference in price between the first and second driver even though it was entirely driver error. After researching this seem to be a somewhat common practice. Will use Lyft in the future.,1.0,0
"I used Uber regularly as well as UberEATS. I loved the convenience! Once... Today I had a meeting across town. When it was over I requested an Uber pool for the cheap price and I had two hours before my next appointment. I'm thinking, ""shouldn't take more than an hour"". I was WRONG! The driver that picked my ride drove past me a minimum of 3x. I saw this on the little gps the app provides. The driver eventually started heading to the OTHER side of town! I tried calling twice to make sure he wasn't lost but he forwarded me to his VM both times and never reached out to me. Eventually, he heads away from my location and the ETA becomes even longer. I tried to cancel to get another driver, but the app charged me $5 to do so. Scared I would just get another ** driver, I contacted Customer service and they say this is a legitimate charge because the driver accepted my ride and it doesn't matter where in town he was or the new ETA after driving past me, only that he took the time to accept the ride.

"I recently had THREE Uber rides charged to my credit card, charges which my bank originally refused. When I complained to Uber via e-mail, I got a series of potted replies, with them eventually asserting that ""they believed the charges were legitimate."" Only after having the charges reversed with my bank and contacting Uber a fifteenth time did I get the explanation that my credit card details must have been acquired OUTSIDE Uber and then linked to an Uber account. This is NOT a very convincing explanation. When the first charge was made to my credit card, my bank supposedly refused it and blocked further charges. For some reason, though, Uber continued to honour my card for additional rides and then blocked me from using their service because of unpaid previous rides. Also, no charges were made to my credit card other than by Uber. And finally, the charges were set up on my credit card as RECURRING charges. How is this even possible WITHOUT some kind of manipulation of the Uber payment system itself? For these reasons, I suspect there is a serious security breach within Uber that they are unwilling to admit.",1.0,0
"I have had an ongoing complaint with Uber and it has finally hit the boiling point. I have been taking Uber quite faithfully twice a day for several months now and my pick up and drop off locations have never changed however Uber consistently changes the one address every time. I was OK with that since I was still getting where I needed to be until they started changing the quoted fees as well. When I called them out on it they would say that they had checked and that the information they had was correct. I have emailed them copies of the address plaque on the building where they are picking me up and they are still insisting that I am being picked up at a different address and that it is a longer ride and therefore a higher fare. The address they are insisting is wrong. Is the address for the commuter train station! The really irritating part is that the place that they are insisting I am being picked up at is the building where they house the trains!!The line I keep getting when asking them to correct the price to what I was quoted is that ""The quote is based on the information that the passenger has put into the app and if that information is incorrect then the revised fare will be charged."" I would think when I have photographic proof that the information I am putting into the app is correct that they wouldn't have a problem correcting the fee that they are charging to the fee quoted, but they instead keep telling me that the information I put in was incorrect! I am fed up with Uber and am considering switching to Lyft since they are now in my area.

"I requested Uber 3/24/17. We were going uptown. I live 10.2 miles from downtown Nashville. My rate was quoted at between $15 and $17. We used Uber there and back. I checked my bank account the next day and to my surprise Uber had charged me $34.50 going to Nashville and $15 coming back. When I inquired about this I was basically given the runaround telling me that I put in a different address than where we went. Once I showed them the Google mileage and the receipt that I printed out from Uber showing that I put in the correct address, now they have changed it to ""It was a demanding night, so the fares went up."" That is really funny because the girl who drove us said it was a slow night. Uber overcharged then tried to lie about it. I will never use Uber again.",1.0,0
"I have been using Uber for a couple of years now. I use UberPool at least once a week. I recently requested a ride home from babysitting and was pretty upset when I was charged more than what I agreed to and that they wouldn't honor the initial price. The price I was told was $5.83, but when I got home I saw that it was $11.12. The driver did miss the exit and add more time and distance, so I figured that once I explain this to customer service that they would refund me the difference as this was not my fault. I hope that the driver didn't do this intentionally. They did not, and are standing by what they charged me. I am pretty heated and I am going to start to use Lyft as much as possible even though it is a little more expensive. I am super disappointed with their customer service.",1.0,0
"I woke up one day to find that someone had ordered a ride using my account in Philadelphia while I was asleep in New York. Naturally, I changed my password and sent an email to Uber's support team so that they could look into the issue. They did not look into the issue whatsoever, would not issue a refund, and failed to provide me with a number to call so that I could speak with a representative. Apparently, if someone steals your information from their poorly protected site/app and uses your money to pay for a ride, all Uber cares about is that someone paid for the ride. This will not be the only place I file a complaint.",1.0,0

"Requested a pickup in Seattle at 4:25PM on March 23rd and the request was accepted with a 7 minute ETA. I placed the pin exactly where I was standing in a very visible spot on a sidewalk that was easy to access. Watched the driver drive all around me on the Uber app but never coming closer than 3 or 4 blocks. After 30 minutes of this a message popped apologizing for the inconvenience, but the DRIVER cancelled, which now made me late for my dinner reservation. Adding insult to injury, I also saw that they charged me a $5 cancellation fee. I immediately disputed this and after many exchanges where I explained what happened and also pointed out that the driver far exceeded 5 minutes past the 7 minute ETA which entitled ME to cancel per THEIR OWN POLICY, the most they would do is ""promise"" a $5 credit on a future ride.Everyone needs to understand that when they use Uber, you pay upfront with no guarantee that they will show up, and if THEY don't, the driver will claim that you were not at your pickup point and you will still be charged a fee. It seems to me that this problem could easily be eliminated by requiring the rider to provide the driver with a random authorization code that was provided by the rider's Uber app in order for them to get paid. They could also avoid missing rider disputes by simply matching the driver's cancellation like caution to the rider's pickup location. If the locations are not in close proximity, in my case he was 4 blocks away, then they know that the DRIVER is the one that improperly cancelled and no fee should be charged. I do not recommend that anyone should use this service without understanding that you may not get picked up and you will still be charged.",1.0,0
"Last Monday 03-13 I called Uber for a ride from Pomona Ca. to Ontario Ca. Airport. I got a contact and it showed approx. $18 dollars. All of a sudden the page went blank. I called Uber again requesting Uber again and the charge came up as $38.00 and gave a name of the driver and he was less than 10 minutes away. So I am in the parking lot of the business with my luggage, when he drove in. I waved to let him know I was the one. I am sure he saw me he was within 50-75 ft. away. Without hesitation he did a hard 180 degrees and sped out of the parking lot and was gone, without a word. I was a bit aggravated, So I dialed up Uber again. To the same pickup and same delivery points.Now the fare had jumped to $64. And change. I wasn't sure what was happening, but I had to have a ride to the Airport, thinking it was a mistake and they would get it right back to the original fare. The 3rd. Driver called me and he said he had a passenger with him and would that be ok. I said yes. He was again less than 10 minutes away. I watched him on my phone as he wandered around. Got down to 1 minute and then he missed the turn and it went to 7 minutes. Well this happened several more times, I called him to tell him where to turn and he said his GPS was messed up. No doubt!! I watched him drive by the address I had given him 3 times.I called him again. Told him to turn around and come back. This took almost an hour for him to get to me. He told me his GPS was not working correctly again. I asked did he know how to get to the Airport... ""Yes"". We didn't go a quarter of a mile and he turned off the road into a Dead in Street. So we had to turn around and start all over again. I pulled out my phone and we used my phone GPS to get us to the Airport. Now Uber has charged me a Surge Fee, whatever that is of 2.9x the original fare. I contacted them thru the only way possible FB and they finally agreed to take $15 off the overcharge. None of this was my fault, and I want the original fare, as to what I owe them. I have contacted my Credit card company and filed a complaint to contest the overcharge. I on this one trip out west used Uber 6 times. I just signed up for Lyft.",1.0,0
"I have been an avid Uber rider for quite a while. But recently, they've been in the business of disabling rider accounts for NO APPARENT REASON. I'm stranded in the freezing rain trying to request an Uber, and my account is disabled and they won't tell me why. They keep telling me it's for SECURITY reasons. Well I pay all of my fares so there's no reason for my account to be disabled. Today was the last straw. I requested a ride to work, which of course needed to be in a timely manner. The driver was initially around 5 minutes away. But 5 turned in to 10 minutes, which turned into 15 minutes. I had no choice but to cancel and I WAS CHARGED A CANCELLATION FEE?? I WAS CHARGED FOR THEIR DRIVER BEING INCOMPETENT. They REFUSED to refund my money even though they so clearly stole it from me. I deleted my account that same day. Please do not support the thieves that run Uber. Try any other rideshare but NOT Uber. They're already overpriced for mediocre drivers that never know where they're going. I have HAD IT with Uber.

"I took uberPOOL and the rate came to 13.40 and used promo code for $5 discount. While alighting my driver said to pay 8.40. I paid cash and alighted.

I didn't want to block the road and cause traffic jam so I settled. Strange! Do you even have credit facility for Uber trips. I didn't give my card details only cash payment. Then how they let me alight for less fare and charge it later. Discrepancy in fares and that too after 5 days charging. I wanted to refund the extra $5/ charged to me but Uber complaint firm asks for my card details when I am dealing in cash only. I would like Uber co to clarify why I was charged extra.

I took on a trust factor with Uber and I got ripped off and was left in cold and I suffered severe pain as well. The drivers are great but whoever is doing the money part they took too much. In return I had no way home. I kept telling them what they did. They kept showing me receipt when days before it was a lot lower.UPDATE on 5/11/17: I contacted Uber and they restored some of my money but I had to keep pushing it... so one thing I've learned is that you go in morning rates are different... and make sure you have enough to cover all.,1.0,0
"I have been a loyal customer of Uber. I cannot even get a hold of anyone. The drivers have been great. However their charging system is unprofessional and unreliable. I am going to have to report lost or stolen due to them. They do surcharges which flash so fast you don't even get a chance to see their charges. They also start charging you for rides that you do not even take or had even requested or even authorized. This is how they get your money and scam you. I wouldn't trust Uber unless it is a once in awhile type of thing, because when you are a continuous customer they drain your account and if you don't watch it closely you could be overdrawn with many fees. Luckily I watch mine. I am going to have to go to Lyft. Hopefully they are better.",1.0,0

"I requested a trip using UberPool. I have been using it daily to the same location. Today, when I received an Uber receipt, my daily charge of $2.99, was higher, $8.18. I used their app to dispute the charge, but receive a crazy response stating that I was charged correctly. They are liars and too lazy to even research the issues. Looking at the map on the app, the driver drove to my location, then continued on. No one else was in the car with me. He should have ended the call when I reached my location.Has Uber gotten so large that their quality of customer service has diminished? They need to monitor their drivers better. If they would have actually researched my issue, I am sure that they would have records of the requested destination that I entered, when I was picked up. The app has GPS. It's also on the map that we went to location that I requested. I don't understand, why I've been charged for going to an address that I did not go to, nor did I request to go to that location. Uber needs to do right by their customers. A few drivers are diminishing the quality of their services. They need to realize that they're not the only company in the game.

I was charged the full price and my $20 discount for getting Uber a new client through the use of my Referral Promo Code was removed from my account and not honored. I wasn't aware of this until I took my return trip home where I was charged about $5 dollars more. Once again my second $20 discount was removed from my account but was not honored. I was charged the full amount of the trip. Additionally, because a driver canceled on me while en route to my location and instructed me to call someone else, Uber charged me a $5 cancellation fee. Uber may have been a promising concept at some point since I've used them many times before, but their customer service has seriously depleted. I used to promote them but now I'm actually doing the opposite and I'm heavily promoting Lyft in my duty as a resort concierge.

"I set up an appointment for a ride on March 4th for a pickup at my location to a ride to my doctor at 160 Kimel Forest Park Drive. Pickup window was 9:45 to 10 a.m. The driver no call no showed me. So after I realized he was not coming like I found another Uber driver that could take me to my dr. appointment. Well unfortunately by the time we got there I was already past my appointment time seven minutes or so so they would not honor my appointment. They told me I had to pay a rescheduling fee because I didn't cancel my appointment within 24 hours. Well there would have been no reason to cancel the appointment if the original Uber driver was on time to take me to my doctor. So once I found out from my doctor after I paid my fee, I meet Lee, called Uber back for a pickup from 140 Kimel Forest Park Drive back to my Residence at **. You can check the records this driver that was originally supposed to pick me up was very unreliable and very unprofessional by not picking up the phone and calling me or notifying me that he wasn't going to be able to make it. At that point I could have gotten another driver that could have got me there on time but he refused to do it. So once I realized he was going to be too late I called for another driver. He got me there a little bit after 10:30 when my appointment was scheduled and I was notified I had to pay a rescheduling fee which I did and reschedule an appointment too immediately. At that time I searched for another Uber driver that could take me home. He pick me up from 164 Kimel Forest Park Drive, took me to my Residence at **. Both the drivers that took me there and brought me home were extremely professional, courteous and a pleasure to ride with. My problem is the original driver who had my original pick up with my time call window from 9:45 to 10. By him not showing up I not only paid for a ride to and from my doctor for no reason because I had no appointment due to the driver being late then I had to pay a rescheduling fee to my doctor which is totally unacceptable.

"On Feb 14th night I was boarding an Uber cab that my daughter booked, when the driver started without checking if I got in or door was closed. Result was that my right foot came under the wheel of the car. I had to shout at him to stop. I asked him to reverse the car and it took him a good five minutes before he inched back a bit. I told him to reverse more as my foot was still stuck. Passers-by had to yell at him before he decided to move back. The pain was unbearable. I did not go to the hospital then as the insurance was left back in my daughters apartment.I decided to return to India and then go to the hospital due to the language barrier in France where comprehending English is a challenge. I didn't want a wrong diagnosis. I have ended up with ligament tear in my right ankle which will take very long to heal. I submitted the hospital report to Uber and told them that they had to compensate for the injury. I wrote to uber support and Natasha called me today and asked if I had had insurance when I was in Paris. I told her instead of asking me to claim insurance, Uber should actually pay compensation for the injury and unwarranted pain caused due to the negligence of the uber driver on duty. I was shocked when she responded that Uber is not responsible for anything that happens to a customer when they are on a ride and I should take this up with the company that the driver works with.This is not only ridiculous but a shame that an established company like Uber is washing of responsibility and leaving it to me the affected passenger to sort out with a third party.

This is my first experience using Uber. I called for a ride and was given a price ($11.00). I accepted the ride and was overall happy with the prompt pick up and driver. Later that month I reviewed my charge card and noticed I was billed again by Uber the next day for an additional $13.00. When I emailed and complained the answer was the driver was unable to calculate the price correctly. I cannot believe Uber can charge my card without my consent! The fact the driver made a mistake is not my problem and the agreed cost should not be altered.This was my first time using Uber. Later I was told I should have been given a discount up to $20 as a new customer. Uber is standing behind the additional charge. This is the worst customer service! I can't believe Uber thinks it's ok to charge my card after the ride. Can you imagine if all store charges could add on an additional cost for whatever reason they wanted! This is not right.

"Uber is one of the most shady unethical companies ever created. I stopped driving for them over a year ago, but decided to try UberEats as a delivery person. I figured it would be better because I wouldn't have to drive people - boy was I wrong. First, they take 35% of every delivery. Then they don't have enough delivery drivers so I noticed I was driving 15 to 20 mins to reach a restaurant (which you are not compensated for), to pick up an order that is being delivered to a location that may be 2 to 3 mins away. Giving the driver a whopping $2.86 for that delivery. I have also gone to pick up orders only to arrive at the restaurant, to find out the order was cancelled and Uber doesn't compensate the driver with a cancellation fee. The order still showed active in my app, but nobody took the time to notify me.After this, I stopped accepting requests that were more than 8 mins away. So, if an order was cancelled, I wouldn't lose anything. So guess what Uber did, they started manipulating the travel time to the restaurants, often times changing it to 1 min away. So when I received the request, instead of it showing the actual 12 mins away, it only showed 1 min. So, you accept the request, and hit navigation and the GPS shows the actual time, and in some cases the restaurants were 12 mins away or more. It didn't work though, because I only deliver in areas that I know really well, so I was well aware that there were no restaurants that close to my location. At first, I thought something was wrong with the app, but Uber never responded, when I asked them why they were manipulating the pickups.Then, there's instant pay. Uber offers the drivers the option to cash out daily using instant pay. Sound like a winner, right? Wrong. Instant pay doesn't work most of the time. There have been several times that I needed emergency money for bills etc. So I would go out and deliver hit the instant pay button and guess what. I've worked 10 hours and I can't get my money. I contact support, which means this will never be resolved and Uber doesn't give a **. I received 15 different reasons from 15 different support reps as to why I couldn't get my money. Uber says keep driving and check back in about a week or 10 days. It should be resolved by then. They charged me for a flimsy delivery bag that I never asked for. I had been delivering for about 3 weeks, when I received something in the mail. I set it aside and never opened it.So a few days later, I was checking my earnings, and I noticed $6.50 was missing. Contacted support to see where my money was, and they told me it was for the delivery bag that I never ordered or asked for. I told them I would like to return it for a refund, because I didn't order it and I didn't open it. Next thing I know, they're like, ""You can keep the bag, and we will give you a refund."" A few days later, I noticed Uber sent an email to me, offering me $10, if I would give them my pay statements from Lyft. When I didn't answer, they sent another email offering me $20. No thanks Uber. That's my private information. I will keep it to myself.Uber lies all of the time, not only to the drivers about earnings, but also to the riders, because they really don't do thorough background checks on their drivers. Nor do they do any research on the restaurants they use for UberEats. A lot of those restaurants I have picked up orders from, have very low health scores. Most are low 80s and high 70s and that's not good at all. They don't have any concern for anyone. They only care about their bottom line. If you deliver for them, make sure you only accept orders that are in close proximity, otherwise you will lose money. Keep in mind, that a court ruled that Uber cannot penalize you for not accepting orders, only for accepting and cancelling them.Well, a few days ago, I needed emergency money again, so I turned on my app and I started my deliveries. I reached my goal, and I hit the button to cash out, but never received my money. I contacted support and was literally blown off. They made no effort to help me at all. I ended up having to borrow money from my mom. The final straw for me was when I attended the Uber q & a, and when the Uber employees were answering some of the questions, they were laughing and being very unprofessional. They were responding to the drivers like they were dumb.I went through all of this in less than 8 weeks as an UberEats delivery driver. I didn't just delete the app. I sent in a request to permanently delete my account. When I sent the delete request, that's when I received a generic response, from Uber, asking, what can they do to help. Well, it's a day late and in my case $180 short. I can't support a company who doesn't care about anyone. If you use this service as a rider, or driver, make sure you pay attention to your money.",1.0,0
"I arrived in Las Vegas 2/21/17, called Uber - driver Judylynn - acted very nice etc. asked if I wanted to charge my cell phone. Not thinking that it wasn't necessary I gave it to her to charge. She dropped me off at a Hotel on the strip. I soon realized I left my phone in her car. Gone! - You can't get in touch with Uber by phone. She won't return it.

How do they keep getting away with things. I use Uber everyday multiple times a day. I've had drivers blow stop signs and drive recklessly etc. I needed an Uber the other night so I used my app and I was connected to Mohammed. He immediately calls me to tell me he is over 20 min. away even though my app which has always been accurate said he is 12 min. away. I told him I would wait. 30 min. later since he obviously took his sweet ** time he pulls up more than halfway up the block. I walk towards him and as I'm about to open the door on the driver's passenger side he drives off. He actually could've hit me and hurt me. I called him repeatedly with no answer. He then pulls up on the other end of the block on a main road. As I speed walk towards him waving my arms he drove off again. I then saw him drive by again and drive around the neighborhood and park around the block from me as you can see it on the app. I called him but nothing. He then cancels the trip and I was charged a cancellation fee. I wrote to Uber because this driver is clearly reckless and their emails are generic and no one really reads anything. They refund the money thinking that that's what my concern is. The emails go back and forth to finally get someone with the name of Lia who was extremely rude and said I didn't have to get a refund because the company didn't need to give me one and we would not meet eye to eye and the case is closed. I have a witness that I was almost hit when he drove off and that is how the company responds to me. Someone who has been a loyal customer and I use Uber multiple times a day. I want something done with the customer service rep Lia and with the driver. I'm not backing down. I've had enough.,1.0,0
"First, I want to say, I've used Ubers for a few months and NEVER had a problem. Wanted to write what happened and let others know Uber is great! A friend always used Uber in Phila. I had no idea what it was. I recently moved to Florida - took a trip back home to Phila. via Tampa airport. The cost for an Uber to airport was $27 and I gave a tip. On my way back from the Tampa airport, I would also use an UBER. WRONG! Again, NO IDEA that Ubers were not allowed near the Airport. After my flight got in LATE evening, I got online to summon an Uber... the site would not pull up. I tried again and again to no avail.Now I was worried and submitted to using a Taxi. I walked over to a few sitting on the side and asked if they were available. They stated yes and where would I like to go? I told them Treasure Island and they told me at LEAST $75. WHAT?!? I said, ""Ubers only charge $27 and I couldn't not get them online. He said, ""You won't - they are NOT allowed here!"" So... the taxi's can rob people. Taxi's don't want Ubers so they can rob people - especially in need... which I was. BUT, I just took a taxi over the bridge and had a friend pick me up. Guess what? I was in the taxi 5 minutes and was charge $36. That's such BS. I got over the bridge - instead of calling my friend... I called an Uber and STILL got home cheaper. Taxi drivers and legal thieves. It really needs to stop!!!",5.0,1
"I had the experience of being stolen from by an Uber customer, despite contacting Uber, using the police as legally expectations, Uber has declined to give the police the information they need to prosecute their thieving customer. It's sad that Uber came into the Kenyan market and is above the Kenya police. They have made it impossible to get reprieve on crimes committed by their drivers, and customers. To get to their security team is an email nightmare. They have no phone communication and have a confused staff who keep sending junk mail despite the complaints.",1.0,0
"Be careful as Uber is getting sloppy with overcharges, not providing credits, and charging Cancellation fees when it was not me who canceled. This All happened within the last week. Uber was late in arrival twice in the last week. They sent me a text message each time stating they would credit the next fare. It was only $1.99 for each ride. I never keep the text messages as I don't remember having this sort of problem. I ride quite a bit so I didn't think anything of the credits until the a couple days after the 2nd ride.I've messaged Uber several times. They want me to provide dates, times, and the text message. I provided the dates and times yet they still ask me for them. I'm flabbergasted they do not have the text messages when it comes to credits. Still working on it. Funny how they want me to provide proof when all they have to do is look at the receipt. Their Customer Service regarding this issue has been a complete joke. Another time they Overcharged me by about $5. If I didn't look at the receipt then they would have screwed me on an overcharge. A driver canceled the ride on me last night and Uber charged me the $5 cancellation fee. I'm still waiting on a response. Now I have to review every charge.",1.0,0
"We all know Uber is lousy (try Lyft instead), but here's another example: Arriving at the Fort Lauderdale airport, tried to do an Uber. It was accepted by the driver, then they called and cancelled saying it was too early for them. They told me to go to the app and cancel it myself (I assume so they could charge me and not get in trouble for cancelling a ride). This happened a second time with a different driver exactly the same. Then finally the 3rd one arrived. Uber didn't charge my credit card for the 2 cancelled fees, instead they charged it for the entire amount of the 2 rides I didn't take and they list it on their site as a cancelled, so if I wasn't paying close attention to my credit card transactions, it would have gone unnoticed. There is no way to contact Uber support either. When you call they tell you to send an email to support@uber.com. Then when you send an email to that address, it comes back as an address that doesn't get monitored or read! Uber sucks.",1.0,0
"I saw the commercials and needed transportation as I am disabled and my knees and legs are also weakened. I opened a Uber account, added a promo code, and thought I was set for my first trip, wrong! I was refused pick up 5 times and was stranded. I tried walking but my legs gave way and fell on the side of the road, a stranger helped me and gave me a ride home. I contacted the company and they stated the account problem is fine on next ride. I was dropped off by a family member before his work, then called Uber again, and again I was refused a ride so I had to pay 25.00 out of pocket as I had my granddaughter which had to be dropped off home then myself.I contacted uber again and they said I must have a credit, debit, Paypal, android, etc. or other form of payment. I explained I did not have these and two reps had confirmed I could just use the gift cards. I requested a refund of the gift card, Uber refused stating, ""Either give us a credit card or no services and we will not give you a refund."" So I sit here with swollen knees, out of 50.00.

I contacted Uber customer service which sucks and was told the driver had an issue which prevented this trip from being timed according to proper pick up and drop off.

I have asked your customer service people to escalate to your Legal department. This is an illegal practice. Then I have to dispute the charges. You are gambling that most people won't complain or won't notice. I notice. Today I canceled two cars within seconds of ordering because the eta was too long.

"My Uber ride from my home to Wal-Mart was enjoyable. I paid $7.80. After shopping, I turned on the Uber app to request a ride. Everything was normal until the moment I pressed ""request ride"". The app moved to view the airport and asked me to select my location. I backed out and tried again, and the app still insisted that I select a location within the airport. Funny thing... There was a blue dot on my REAL PICK up location, but the app was not allowing me to click on the blue dot. When I manually entered my location, it still swung back to the airport!!! I had my 2 yr old with me and had no choice to agree to the ridiculous overcharging. When I brought this to Uber's attention, I was dismissed and they gave me a response of ""It was higher because of the demand for the Uber service""... Yeah... OK!!!

"Two days ago I took a trip with Uber in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. I normally use this service every day. Another passenger with me on the trip forgot their phone in the car. Since then we have sent about 20 messages to Uber Customer service. They finally determined that the driver found the phone but we are still waiting for it to be returned. Uber and the driver now have my direct contact information and yet the only way I can get any feedback is through the Uber Customer Service system.

I've been driving for Uber for a while now and the Uber navigation application is a total disappointment. When you accept a rider request the address for the rider disappears from the application screen leaving you at the mercy of the Uber application which doesn't navigate very well.

Then the Uber application routes you to the wrong location and doesn't understand what direction your car is actually going I used both Google maps and Waze applications and had the same issue. The Uber application doesn't interface with either well and has you going in circles quite often. Uber will waste your time and money when you make some. Uber gets a big portion of it in fees.

"Well when I sign up with Uber I was looking for some extra income on the side. In the beginning it started pretty slow, but I figured some things out to make decent money using Uber. Like some of the previous reviews the money you make doesn't really cover all of your expenses like gas, car maintenance, etc. For example your total trip fee is 407.80 - Uber fee 103.21 = my actual earnings 304.59 - gas $70 = 234.59 for about 27 online hours. Which comes out to be about 8.69/hr below minimum wage. I put up with it because I needed the money. However just recently on 01/20/2017, I pick up three passengers and I had my husband drive for me because I wasn't feeling well. I was also in the vehicle because it is my account, one of the three reported to Uber that my husband was the driver and not me. Uber put my account on hold until a so call investigation is complete. I received an email from Uber about the situation. They said since some else drove beside me that I will be ban from Uber-Partner. I email back and said that, ""Why didn't I just get a warning on the first offense instead of a complete ban?"" They said they have zero tolerance on account sharing based of their guidelines/policies and that was it as a Uber Driver. Their customer service sucks, they don't even try to call you for these matters. I told them if I had seen the guidelines beforehand I would have not let my husband drive.

He finally came to the place where we got it and he kept circling the place for five minutes so I called Bewkete and asked him if he needed directions and he told me, ""No. I'll be there later."" So I waited and saw that he left then started going in the opposite direction we were going and went out 5 miles away. So I called him again and he didn't answer. So he texted me back saying, ""I'll talk to you later.""I was pissed since now we have waited for almost 30 minutes now and it said that he had already picked us up. Even the manager at the counter of the hotel said ""What a jerk for just leaving you there."" So I went to cancel the ride and it said that I would still have to pay for it. So I called another one and it came within 5 minutes and he took me to where I was going. I really don't like that you make me pay for this. You need to hire drivers with better people skills and better skills at finding locations. I guess I'll have to use Lyft since they have better customer service and drivers. It might only cost me 12.10 but to be charged and not even ride is wrong.",1.0,0
"I am now writing this review as NOT ONE PERSON AT UBER is assisting me. I have now for 9 weeks not being paid for my ETA's, I am absolutely disappointed. When us as Uber partners don't accept each and every request, it affects our profile, but yet, Uber does not come to the party? Why are ETA's not being paid? Why has Uber not been making efforts to look after their Partners the way the Partners look after Uber?I have easily submitted about 30-40 emails in the past 8 weeks and all I am getting back are automated computerised responses? I used to submit between 10-25 ETA's per week, but Uber hasn't been paying out the ETA's. If I don't accept each and every trip, I get penalised, but yet, Uber has no interest in their Partners?I have posted on HelloPeter but clearly UBER has no concern about their reputation in the market, whether negative or positive and I can guarantee you, at the moment, there is not much positive being said about UBER. This is honestly frustrating, disappointing and demotivating. I was told two weeks ago that my issues are being looked into and are being investigated. Mohamed sent an email saying he has taken my problem up as his own? Really? I don't know what else to do for assistance, could anyone advise who I should contact to get this sorted and to get paid???

"On Wednesday 11th January (@ 6:19PM) I booked Uber Cab and Uber app showed waiting time approx 10 mins, in between I then checked my mails for 2-3 mins, and when I opened Uber app again (after 4mins) it showed nothing (means it looked like no cab was booked, and in fact I didn't see booked cab details). I then opened Uber app and booked the cab again (@6:26 PM) and successfully trip completed.Next day (12th Jan) I got a notification of (50Rs Cancellation Fees - too much frustrating...) and when I checked trips history I got to know that this is a cancellation fee - which I booked yesterday (11th at 6:19PM). But to be honest, I didn't want to cancel that trip(11th Jan @ 6:19PM), in fact Uber App did not show my booked trip details at the same time, that's why I booked Uber cab again at 6:26 PM, so how could I cancel that trip.In conclusion, you are charging cancellation fees because of your fault only. If Uber app doesn't show booked cab details then how would I cancel that? You know I started using Uber services since last month only, and earlier I used to book OLA cabs, I didn't face this issue in OLA. And one more suggestion to you, Uber app performance is not as good as OLA app. If you trust your customer, then please don't charge that unwanted cancellation fees, because I am not the culprit for that. I sent mail to Uber for all the above concern, but they don't reply because they don't care.",1.0,0
I have been driving with Uber for over three months. I have great reviews from passengers who I have dropped off at many locations all around Orlando. I strongly recommend that no one drives with Uber. They are complete rip off. You will spend more money on gas and put so many miles on your car that you don't even make enough to fill your tank back up and on top of that if there's a rude passenger which Uber does not confirm who the passenger is. They will cause damage to your car and once he reported to Uber they will tell you that he sent it off to an insurance adjuster and I did no longer responsible. Any insurance adjuster will tell you that you have to pay $1000 or more to fix your own car. They don't want to take responsibility for anything and when you sign up for Uber it clearly states that they are responsible for damages caused by passengers.I do not recommend for anyone to drive with Uber. They are ripping everyone off passengers and driver. I have to now file a lawsuit against Uber because I asked him for the information on the passenger who damage my car and they won't give it to me and then they send me a email saying they don't have that information on the passenger so don't risk your personal property for this company.,1.0,0
I had my rating at 4.8 with 2500 plus rides and no complaints from Uber for 5 months. I uploaded this video which is on this page created by somebody else. Within few days I received an email from Uber and they wanted to talk over the phone... To my surprise because they never have live person that you can talk. Told the guy that they need to provide me with a lawyer and that they must pay for high tech cameras so I can protect myself while driving for Uber. They said that they will not do anything and following day they shut down my access and couple months later they discontinued my partnership for violating company policy. To this day I don't know what I did and they refused to provide AAPD with all the records... Stating that none can be found.,1.0,0

"We used Uber to travel 8.2 miles from our hotel to downtown Nashville on New Years Eve. The fare was approximately $15 which was reasonable. When we were ready to leave on New Years Day the Uber app showed because of the high demand our fare increased to 9.7 times. It was raining and there we did not see other choices (taxi's, buses, Lyft) available so I agreed to this. Our bill to go back to our hotel was over $140.00. I received an invoice from our first fare of $15.00 but I never received an invoice from the $140.00 fare. I emailed Uber about the invoice and did not receive a response. Nothing that I read in the Uber app discussed this and I feel this is completely underhanded of Uber to pull this kind of a stunt.",1.0,0

That is ridiculous how uber trick people, after I spent more than $7.000 now my car is to hold. Uber is a big rip off company and I never recommend to nobody to work for uber.

"Driving for Uber is depressing and not satisfying. I would say 20% to 30% of people are completely irrational and have unrealistic expectations. Driving rich, hollow, and entitled people in my car is not a joy. After making a small comment to a rider about living on a hill I was asked to turn up the radio immediately. I laughed at how rude the exchange was. I picked up a lady from a BMW dealership. She told me the dealership booked her a ride. She immediately told me she was not pleased with the car, that she likes nice cars even though the car is clean 2015 Honda Civic.The hours put into tolerating passengers, wasting gas, and depreciating your car's value is challenging. Many customers cancel even though you can drive to the destination and receive no compensation for the ride. Handing out candies and providing phone plugs for people in a minimum wage job is a bit excessive almost akin to sexual favors at a fast food restaurant. Basically, once the customer is in your car you have to absorb whatever excrement they spew to support their delicate ego. I would not advise anyone to do this job. The pay is ridiculous. Driving people around for 3 dollars here and 4 dollars here is thievery.",1.0,0

My daughter called me and said the driver was demanding $25 for my key because he turned off his meter to bring my keys. Before she could get license plate number he drove off.

"First there is no customer service. Everything is done by email - whenever they answer those yes once after 30 or more of mine. So I get down Hayward coming from Richmond CA. I get my appointment. I had was 400 p/m when call the appointment center they put me down for 200 on so I had call them to correct them on that so I get because I couldn't ask questions until you get how much money do I need to start with. No one has answers so I didn't have enough money to top that it was 415 on still call my name ""Do you know how much longer it will be?"" Said, ""I don't"" so they my time and now when I could ask questions now let go. Today ask how much does it start at. I was told by customer around 120 a week but the appointment center said starts at 80 a week. Wrong again. When could ask a question always wrong answers. Now I talked to a sales person they start at 157 a week. Then told me she has great news. Found one for 137.I was happier then she shows me the car but car is locked. Go get the key. They can't find the key. ""Is someone going look for the?"" Said, ""No call special locksmith. I said, ""How long will that take?"" She ""You can come back in a few days.""

I drove for Uber earlier this year and was displeased with the customer service. I had to stop for a while. I was ready to start again a few weeks ago. I had trouble getting my account in order so I made the 160 mile round trip to the office. I got my documents updated and active and I could not get online.

"After seeing many promises of making money for driving people from place to place and all you need is a license and a four-door car 2004 or newer I obtained my driver's license and purchased a brand new car.

"We ordered an Uber Select ride home from the airport (this was not the first time we rode Uber Select). While waiting for the ride, which was 7 minutes away when we ordered it, the driver cancelled for some reason. We had to reorder the ride. And we got the same driver, who did come a few minutes later. The ride home was no problem, but we got a cancellation fee of $10 that showed up on our credit card transactions. We got on the app and online to request a refund. The message we got was that we were not charged the cancellation fee; but it still showed up on our credit card account. We call our card company and was given a phone number at Uber to call first. We called and got a message that no human will answer us, and we should email to support@uber.com.

It's nice that Uber can help people to bring where they want to go. But I am not happy much so when they don't give back cancellation fees and trip that never take still. They charge. Some drivers are good but some they are not. Start a trip without being pick up is sucks because they will charge you no matter what. Also some drivers they don't know how to used GPS and take you a long trip which fees getting higher and change without knowing it. Hope they can fix it and return Riders Money because that is stealing on Uber Part.,1.0,0
"I started driving for Uber on November 17. I took them up on their offer to rent a car through Enterprise. I have seen the charges on my account where the vehicle is being paid for/deducted out. This past weekend, Uber temporarily deactivated my account because my vehicle registration and insurance ""expired"". I resubmitted my documents several times and only received a generic response about how they were invalid. I had no recourse based on these email responses until the following Monday when the local office opened back up, which prevented me from working the whole weekend. The Greenlight Hub's response was that it's my problem that I couldn't get it fixed over the weekend. Today, I received a call from Enterprise saying they have had no payments made on my vehicle's account. So now I'm 86% convinced they have a Wells Fargo-setting-up-fake-accounts-for-commission-type scam going on, because I have a feeling that when I go talk to Enterprise in the morning, Uber is going to throw this all back on me, the driver, who has no control or real access to their flawed system that lacks any real support.

"This past weekend I drove for Uber at 4:00 p.m., the app was doing some weird things like trying to restart and re-log. I rebooted my phone several times and I still had the same problem. Then I received a message stating that my password and debit card was invalid. So I reverified everything and even put in my debit card again. That was when the nightmare began! I received an email confirmation that the funds were transferred from my account to my bank account. Assuming it was there (bad on my part), I spent the money, only to come home and find out that Uber did not pay my bank!!! So I messaged them several times, and they have changed their story SIX different times!!! I am very fed up with Uber right now as a driver. I loved to drive, but the customer service and how they treat their drivers when there is a payment issue is unbelievable! I need to know where I can file a complaint against them about this. First they say my debit card needed approval, then they said their servers for instant pay were down. Then the email I got from them said that I won't get the money until Friday. Then they stated that it was a fault of my debit card WHICH WAS FINE IN THE FIRST PLACE! They even told me I would have the money in my account on Monday, December 12, 2016. But they kept changing that date as well and pushed it back even until December 16, 2016. This is the worst customer service that I have ever experienced in my entire life!!! Can someone please point to me where I can file a complaint against them? Obviously they do not want to stick to one answer. It's like I am talking to a robot and not a live person.

"It's a very simple matter. I've been using UberEATS to place orders for food. It has a program in place where if you refer someone you get 15 off. I had 3 invite codes so I placed an order for a pizza. The total came to 4.99 with my 15 off discount (which I have the receipt saved for it). Afterwards they went into my account and altered it without my knowledge and removed my promos after I placed the order and sent out a receipt for 19.99. I called them and they slightly hinted towards my account being altered by someone in email support but they didn't expand on that matter and acted as if they didn't see any of my invite codes. I contacted email support which within itself is a problem because you never speak to the same rep between messages it's always alternating, so make a long story short they kicked me off the referral program without a discernible explanation and refuse to refund me for the previous honored deal that was placed before I was kicked off the program. This isn't the first time I've had problems with them but it's getting old and dealing with multiple support agents saying multiple things is tiresome. Had I done anything wrong I'd accept the ruling but I know I did nothing wrong. I was silenced and refused the chance to reply to random messages from random agents.",1.0,0
"I ordered for an Uber pool today which is the 12/08/2016. Not only did Uber give a wrong pick up location to the driver but also charged my card twice for the correct rate and incorrect rate. After waiting 10 min in the cold for the driver, I had to direct him to the right pick up location. When he picked me up, he advised he had to first pick up to people at the Marriott which was ok with me because I had ordered for Uber pool anyway. We pick up the couple and I was dropped first. Later when I got the chance to look at my Uber receipt, I noticed they had charged me price that they did not quote for me at the time I was ordering the Uber. On checking my bank account I was charged twice by Uber for the right price they had quoted for me and the wrong price which I think was for the couple I pooled with. They reversed the right fare I was quoted for charging me for the wrong fare plus booking fees and dc Uber taxes which have never been charged before. I am so disappointed in Uber and the fact that they do not have a number to call is frustrating. Their service is helpful but I think they are becoming rip offs and unless I get my money back, I will never use Uber again or recommend it to anyone.

I replied saying that 1) the locations were stated in my initial email. 2) my email is attached to my uber account.

"They do not pay enough anymore to work for. Does not even cover costs to operate and maintain a vehicle AND make a minimum wage from. Too many short rides which = NO MONEY. $2.96 each short ride.

You'll make 5 times more money delivering pizza, not even kidding. And you won't have to deal with the rude people getting in and out of your car slowly ruining it. Corporate does not give a crap about you or your car, just the money you're earning THEM. So if you're thinking about driving for them, get on, do 30 rides, collect your $100 referral bonus from them, and dip and switch to LYFT.",1.0,0
"I took my first Uber in Atlanta this weekend, and I have to say I was highly impressed! The whole ride cost $19.96, we were picked up in a very clean late-model sedan, the driver was very nice. I felt very safe while he was giving us about a 15 minute ride to a suburb of Atlanta! Same ride would've probably cost nearly $50 with a cab!!! I will take Uber whenever I can!",5.0,1
"My son accidently left his laptop in an Uber car. He realized that just a few minutes after the Uber car already gone. He tried to contact the driver through Uber apps, however the driver was not helpful at all. The Uber management try to help but cannot force the driver to help since the driver is an independent contractor which does not have direct responsibility to the management. Characteristic of relationship between driver and management at Uber, make passenger vulnerable. Passenger cannot ask the management to be responsible of the driver behavior.",1.0,0
"Last night (Nov. 18), Uber driver Dietrich in Torrance/Redondo Beach took off with my 17-year-old daughter's birthday money, gift cards, bank card, and expensive purse (~$350 total) when she briefly stepped out of the car as they stopped the ride to pick up a friend. She literally chased after the Toyota Yaris, but he wouldn't stop. She called the driver; he told her he'd come back. She waited two hours until 1 a.m. and he didn't. She contacted Uber support, who contacted the driver, who of course denies anything was in the car.",1.0,0
"EXTREMELY disappointed with Uber. 5 days ago my account with Uber was hacked and someone in Australia (I am a US resident and have never even traveled there) charged my card upwards of $100. I had to cancel my credit card and am currently moneyless as I am away at school with no bank nearby. I have contacted Uber FIVE times and NO RESPONSE whatsoever. I cannot cancel my account as Uber does not allow customers to call a support line, forcing me to communicate via messages through my account. Ironically, none of my messages have been answered and someone is still attempting to use my account. The company does not allow you to remove credit card information from your account unless you add in another. I will never use Uber again and I recommend you do not either. If something goes wrong you will have no help whatsoever from this unprofessional company.",1.0,0
Oct 20th ride from Milwaukee Airport to downtown which normally takes 15 minutes and did take that time again. Driver wrote down 25 minutes and charged me $61.00.

"When I first began operating as legal public utility transportation company serving my island community here in Hawaii, I was desperate for new business and Uber could not find an actual insured, state or county LICENSED transportation company to serve our airport. After being heavily recruited to put my BMW's in their Black-Select service at the airport with assured decent compensation, I took them up on their offer with one perspective - if they have customers that are ready NOW who will pay their fares, I would have been a fool not to be the only Uber available at a popular airport serving the wealthiest travelers in the US... & be doing it legally in the eyes of state and county governmental as an INSURED AND LICENSED PUC operator.Our investment: We paid the Seller's hefty regulated license cost of the PUC certificates, bought/financed BMW cars, insured them FIRST/prior to our lawful APPLICATION to transfer those certificates as prescribed by law. Then we waited for two and half months and received our lawful passenger transportation license recognized by state and county government. After 7-10 days of ""processing"" my application, we finally got started. Then the ""Comedy of errors"" began.My average wait time at the airport was 5-90 minutes, no flights brought Uber passengers before 10:00 AM or after 3:30PM until the next wave of long over the water flights came in at 8:00 PM to about 10:00PM, and then nothing. Some days you couldn't lose, most days you got 1-3 runs to a nice resort and filled in the gaps. It started out like a good date then went south.Uber history if you didn't know: Uber started out and for several years only used limo services thus their ""illegality"" was moot. They operated as a travel agency referring rides to idle town car drivers filling in dead time, excellent idea. After Uber was called out on UberX unlicensed vehicles and drivers masquerading as low cost taxis, they did the ""political pivot"" and said they were a technology company, not a transportation company subject to the local/state licensing requirements. They played the ""extra income for single mom's & struggling two income families making ends meet"" card. What they neglect to say is that newly directed income to Uber drivers rightfully belongs to the LICENSED operators paying the fees, insurance and being subjected to government scrutiny.Ohhh... The DRUNKS!! After six semi-successful winter months, one Saturday night, these idiots drunks complained after a reggae concert that I would not go to a wild street party and leave the airport to pick up UberX rides as a Black car which in one night's complaints, drove my score down to 4.6 - they turned off my apps and said via ""chat"" that I needed to take an online customer service class for $37. Since my company began, my rating had earned 12 consecutive five stars, which most carefully worded letters of customer praise and satisfaction. And, I had well over 1,000 trips under my belt, and heard daily ""this is the nicest Uber I have ever been in."" Like I need to take a $37 ** class on customer satisfaction!I refused to be punished for choosing not to get vomit in my car, puke smells for days and the stains NEVER come out - I refused to take the course or I was out. A Honolulu manager called, begged me to pay the $37 and take the course after I openly voiced my anger over the BS they expected me to put up with, and after weeks of cutting our referring percentage to Uber from 20% to 27.5%, I looked harder for my own business, succeeded and told Uber where to put it. If you now have drawn the conclusion that I may know a little bit more than the next civilian, read the points below to see where the real problems lie.1. Who is driving? Uber refuses to submit driver profiles for vetting. We should be ""OK"" with their own SF background checks. Really? 2. Does the driver have experience in this field that may require SOME basic fundamentals, like not stopping in traffic to drop a rider? Our island requires a 50 question local knowledge test in English to get a 75% or higher or NO LICENSE TO DRIVE TAXIS. GPS is OK occasionally but not as a guide to deliver people safely. 3. No breath test by a supervisor, drunk, stoned, stupid? Self supervised, really? 4. Absolutely NO local supervision or manager phone contact in an emergency.5. No commercial insurance or hotel insurance endorsements. 6. No legally obtained or intended transportation certificates applied for or granted. 7. No safeguards to ensure drivers don't offer riders 20% off their return ride if they pay cash - it happens all day long. 8. Surge is the biggest unchecked scam - many nights and days the app would say ""2.5x"" which translated to 2.5 more requests than drivers available. Then you sit there waiting for a dispatch and then nothing... silence, no runs but the duped riders didn't know that more drivers were really available than advertised. This is Fraud!! 9. Dangerous drivers - I submitted a clear photo to Uber mgt of a dizzy driver with three toddlers and three adults in a Chevy Malibu, TWICE, and he still is driving!!Driving people is a serious business and the younger crowd don't get it yet because they haven't been to enough DUI funerals for friends to register that Uber is absolutely absent when it comes to knowing if their drivers are sober, high, oversexed or too inexperienced and crash focusing on a GPS instead of just knowing their town like a pro or at a minimum, a pizza delivery man. Uber's convenience does not bear more value than common sense regulation of passenger safety. Laws were written to avoid problems and punish offenders, Uber thinks they're above that threshold, how obtuse or arrogant can you be?",1.0,0

"I have been driving for Uber for four months now. This past Halloween weekend, which is also a very busy football weekend in the area where I live and drive, I drove expecting and knowing that there would be surge pricing. We have some 1000+ college students coming into town for the FL/GA football game. I picked up three different groups of riders from the surging area (it was surging for two solid hours - that is how busy we were). When I got home after these trips I noticed that the fares were not close to what the surge pricing would make them. I immediately emailed customer service about each one of the trips, because you cannot do them but one at a time. I could not get them to understand that the surge pricing was not showing up like it showed on the map.I received the same lame computer generated response, which made it clear to me either it was a computer responding, or it was someone that did not speak or understand ENGLISH. I receive responses that plainly showed to me that they are not comprehending that the app was acting up. I received responses from 15 different representatives, and 40+ emails wasting hours of my time and theirs and it has been five days and still no one has comprehended what the problem was or compensated me for my driving. It is a simple fix, as I know that they track everything in real time. I have corresponded with them prior and know that they keep GPS on the drivers at ALL TIMES. And yes probably on the riders also. Spooky huh?Uber also stated in one email, when I asked to speak with a supervisor or someone that understood english, that they claim that they do not have that capability. WHAT??? Probably because it is computer generated and no actual person is in control. I would NOT recommend driving for UBER. They stiff both drivers AND riders. They also claim that they send requests for pickup to the closest driver at the time, but I know that is NOT true. I have had several trips where the rider/s was in the car with me, requesting a driver and they send someone miles away. I thought the first time this happened that perhaps it was a glitch, but when it happens over and over, and you end up giving the person a ride totally free of charge because they are already in the car with you and the app is not sending me the request or even showing on their app that I am available.I do not understand why they would send drivers that are so far away when I was literally inches away. They want us drivers to waste our money and gas driving to pick up a rider that is farther away and not sending the closest driver and having the rider waiting for long periods. I thought the idea was so that riders did NOT have to wait too long. Now as soon as I hit send, I will bet that my account will be suspended. Like I said they track EVERYTHING... WWWHHHOOO. Yes it's spooky.",1.0,0
"On Oct. 7, 2016 we needed a ride to the airport so we called Uber. We needed a XL truck. Randy came in a Lincoln Navigator. Soon as the meter started he said ""I need gas."" Now mind you the meter already started. We get to the gas station. He decides to stop the meter and cancel the trip. At $9.98, you won't get charged. He said ""But we're 1/2 a mile from our starting point."" So, he ends the trip, gives himself 5 stars. So we start over. He says he'll fix it. Instead of getting on the freeway he drives down Gratiot. I'm like ""what's wrong with the freeway."" He replied ""Uber is saying this is the way to the freeway."" Okay, traffic is light, it might cut off 5 mins. Then when we get by the freeway entrance he makes a wrong turn. I'm from Detroit and know how to get around.So I say ""Where you going? This isn't the right way."" Oh he says and turns around. Goes down 1/2 a block to the freeway. His response is ""You were right."" When we get to the airport he passes the Jet blue drop off and has to circle around running up the meter. When we finally get to the drop off zone he says ""Call me and I'll pick you up, off the meter for $50 flat rate. Now I just paid $82.12 for the second ride. Please!!! So, I report it to Uber. They offer me a $10 credit. I'm not using your service again. What didn't you understand when I said that...",1.0,0
Repayment of money taken from my account. On the 18 of Oct. 4 withdrawals were made on my account for a service that I did not order. This was clearly a fraud committed.

"In many occasions almost daily bases Uber has underpay. Misentered time and mileage. Of course I have done my best to adjust the correct payment or close to compromising amount, but costing me spending long times to get corrections. This has become a common practice by Uber.

Repetition of this practice is so often that I would like the authorities look into the matter to protect the drivers who don't realize or have no means.",1.0,0
"My friend and I called for an UBER to pick us up and take us back to my friend's place which was about 3 miles away. First he was 15 minutes late, I had to get the security guard to get on the phone with him to locate him as he could not find us. We walked to his car once he arrived, I noticed he was taking us on a longer route, as we had taken an Uber to get to the same place before a simpler much shorter route.As we arrived, he saw that my friend was not feeling well in the back seat, he started screaming at her and grabbed her so violently by her arm and very rudely shouting ""get her out of the car"". The charge was about 32 dollars for the fare. The next day I get an email that says I was charged 150 for a clean up fee. That's just ridiculous. My friend woke up saying her arm hurt, and I looked and saw his finger marks on her arm from the night before. This is not an acceptable way to treat your customers. People Uber to not get into car accidents when they have been drinking, she threw up in the car, yes, but you have no right to inflict harm on your customer, and charge them $150 to clean up vomit?

Uber confirmed cancellation, nonetheless, charged me $5.00 for cancelling because 9 minutes had passed! WHAT A RIP OFF!! And now they are trying to introduce flying cars!!

I sent 6 emails reporting the activity and asking for someone to contact me.

Since yesterday I can't get into my account and still no contact from an Uber representative. My bank has taken care me on their end...but Uber should at least acknowledge the issue I brought to them. I'm using social media to help get the attention of Uber and asking for anyone who can to deactivate their Uber accounts and uninstall their app to please do so.

He said he can come in 10 minutes and meet us where he dropped us. But we were boarding and did not have enough time. At that point he gave us his phone no. and we told him we will call him in 4 days when we get back. 4 days later, upon our arrival, we called him and asked about the painting and he goes no painting. I had a Spanish person call him but he totally refused that he does not have any painting. We have contacted Uber so many times but no help at all. They should really stand behind their customers.

"Doesn't matter if you agree to price surge. You are forced to agree when you have no other means of transportation and need to get home.

You earn my customer loyalty when you charge me fair prices even though you don't have competition. Under a mile and $28.95. ** you.",1.0,0
"I started driving for Uber when I saw an ad on my phone claiming that I can make up to $35/hour. I drove for a total of about 30 trips. I came nowhere near making $35/hour. The fact is, after my expenses, I made as little as.15 cents per mile, equaling my guess of less than $4/hour. After around 60 days, I received a notice that I had to pay for a car inspection. This is when I decided to stop driving for Uber. So I have two complaints: The first is that Uber is falsely advertising the pay rate for their drivers. How can they keep getting away with this? Second, when I informed them that I would no longer drive for them, they blocked me as a rider. Childish and petty are the words I would use to describe Uber's business practices.",1.0,0
"Been trying to start for weeks now. I'm trying to do this on the side. I know I'm not going to get a lot of money out of it. Their support is a joke, like somebody mentioned. I uploaded all of my paperwork. It was not going through and I had to contact them. After weeks of standard replies they finally sorted it out. Now I had to go through a background check. There is no way you can do that through your account profile. I waited on them to send me a link so I can do it. I finally did it. I received an approval and I was ready to go. I was given a $50 towards my first ride if I do it by midnight the same day. Got home ready to go only to find out my account was suspended for some reason.

After numerous of emails again and people that have absolutely no idea of what they are doing, after promises that they will look into this and I will get a response in 48hrs... a week later they finally sort everything out and my account was activated yesterday.

"Uber is about the worse company for customer service. You can only deal with emails back and forth until you give up. This practice should be illegal. They should be required to have an active customer service line where people can call to have their problems resolved. For one their surcharge pricing is nothing short of price gouging. My daughter has had to pay $31 for an $8 fare. Also on a different trip when my other daughter left her bag in a car, the driver never got back to us and Uber just kept emailing contact the driver. It was ridiculous.Wish they had Lyfts by us. Uber is a great concept but they are really blowing it. My last issue was when they tacked $80 on for cleaning to one of my daughters Uber charges. After the driver told her and her friends there would be no additional charge, we didn't even bother trying to call and complain because we know you cannot complain or even reach a customer service agent. This will become a very dangerous practice. Someone will need to step in and insist they have customer service agents available to speak to.",1.0,0

"I strongly discourage everyone from using Uber. It's only worked 1 out of the mere 3 times that I tried using it, which is plenty enough for me to steer clear for life. The other 2 occasions were a complete nightmare; the second time I tried it, I was informed that my ride would arrive to my work place in 6 minutes, but then it changed to 12 minutes then finally 32 minutes. Eventually I was waiting for an hour and a half and finally gave up. I'm sure that if I had waited longer it never would have arrived. Yet, I must mention that while watching the map on my iPhone to see when the driver was close, I specifically saw another Uber driver no more than a mile or 2 away and they just kept going. The third time I tried using Uber I entered where I needed to be picked and my destination. I noticed on the map however that the driver was going straight to my (end) destination. I then texted him to clarify where I was, but he called me irritated because he was, as I suspected, at the place where I needed to be and not where I was waiting to be picked up. He claimed that I entered my address wrong and that he was in an entirely different city! I know everyone makes mistakes and apps can be glitchy, but waiting for an hour and a half one day with a no show, plus the app sending my driver to the wrong place (but apparently it was my fault) another day is the worst customer service I've ever had. This thing needs to be shut down.",1.0,0
Uber has terrible customer service. They have tried to automate their support to a point where the human component has been removed. Anyways today I have an actual issue. I took a ride that was quoted $5 and when I was charged $5 for. I received an email from Uber saying they updated the fare to $20. The explanation was the driver had a problem with the timing?

I've accepted every single fare that popped up on my phone. And you, as a driver, have no way to look at your actual customer ratings yourself.

Plus it's difficult to find a break in the day to visit a ladies room or to eat. It's sooooo not worth it. Really not worth it.",1.0,0
"My friends and I (4 females) were leaving Oracle Arena in Oakland California after a concert to go back to our hotel. We waited 1 hour and watched him pass us and several times before he actually stopped. We got on the freeway and rode for about 5 mins and he said we cancelled the ride. We hadn't cancelled at all. He pulled off the freeway under a dark bridge surrounded by abandoned buildings and said ""get out"" because he wasn't insured. It was about 1 AM. We begged and pleaded to take us to a place populated with lights and offered to pay cash.A police car passed. I rolled the window down to wave for help. He rolled the windows up and put on the child locks so we couldn't get out. Our phones were going dead. He said ""what are you gonna do?"" We managed to call Uber and request another ride. He started driving around and the other Uber driver had to find us as we yelled out landmarks and street signs. Only after he saw the other driver did he unlock the doors. This was the scariest thing I have ever experienced. This was my second ride with Uber. The first was earlier the same day going to the concert.",1.0,0
"After giving 1000 rides for Uber I was deactivated (fired) for low ratings (which is 4.6). I was told to take a on-line course which I had to pay for to be re-instated. Forget that. Uber thinks that all their riders are sober, sane, and kind people. Well they're NOT! I put up with so much nonsense for a $4 ride I should write a book. Uber never talks to a driver. If a driver has a problem it's ** outta luck time. Uber hides behind a computer and never communicates directly with any driver. They take whatever a riders says at face value, no questions asked. I think there should be a class action lawsuit for firing without cause. How could a company hire and fire hundreds of employees a week? Pay averages out to $12 to $15 dollars an hour. You pay gas and maintenance on your vehicle and car washes are not cheap. Riders, what do you want? Because a safe ride from point A to point B is all you're paying for.",1.0,0
"When I arrived at Spokane, WA. I was highly recommended to utilize uber. When I scheduled my appointment via their app, the price was quoted anywhere from $11-$15. When you use their app you don't know what you are being charged until 5 mins after you leave the car when I got the shock of my life $53.46 to travel 15 mins. Way, way more than a cab. I was told I was charged $41 surcharge and that I was supposed to have been informed of this. So upset with uber, that I have vowed to never use them ever again and will tell all my friends, co-workers etc. of my upsetting experience! To add, I had to tell the driver to cut off the meter and get my own bags out of the trunk! Absolutely unacceptable!",1.0,0
"I used Uber for the first time on Saturday morning - 24.09.16. After my friend booked me a taxi via her phone. I had never heard of the company before, as I don't use many taxis. I wasn't aware at the time of booking - payment is taken. The taxi driver asked how much I had been quoted online as I was leaving Didsbury, Manchester to Prestwich. The taxi meter was set at £3.75 and he stated the journey was approx 20 miles. I felt confused at the time as the driver appeared to be questioning how I was going to pay. I informed him I didn't have money and therefore he would have to stop at an atm. He took me the longest way home and I was charged nearly £54 for the journey!The driver never once informed me that the payment was already confirmed and accepted online at the time of booking. It wasn't until I had spoken with my friend within a few hours - she had already paid for the journey online - £28. Therefore the journey cost a huge £82!! I feel completely violated and apoplectic towards the company for being overcharged. The driver has taken advantage of my vulnerability on traveling alone in the early hours... I am still waiting to hear from the company about the overpayment!",1.0,0
"Uber's customer accounts has been hacked and they are not reporting it to their customers. This will show up when you start getting unexpected charges on the credit card you listed on your account. You may get a receipt in your email for a trip or even Uber Eats in another state where you haven't traveled. On Uber Eats they can actually order food and have it delivered, and the total bill will be charged to your credit card. We had 2 for over $80. Since Uber has no efficient way to contact their Customer Support you may have to get creative to get their attention by sending messages through their Help system. If you are an Uber user you should consider changing your password immediately and possibly closing your account altogether. Of course you can't just do this simply and easily.

"I am shaking as I write this post. I had to pull over to gather my thoughts. As I was driving west on century just outside the airport an Uber driver (black Prius, I believe-or something similar) turned right on to century directly in front of me and another car. We both slammed on our breaks and swerved to the left to avoid an accident. As he approached my right side, he rolled down his window and gave me the middle finger while yelling at the top of his lungs saying ""** YOU, go back to your country."" I'm sorry, I was born and raised in LA. I have white skin with blue eyes. My son has blonde curly hair. Do we stand out as foreigners? Even if we did, would that be a bad thing?The driver wouldn't stop with his aggression. He kept swerving over into my lane and the people behind us were honking. He followed me almost to my destination while following extremely close until I turned onto Lincoln while heading north on sepulveda. He was close enough to get a picture of him in his Uber car, sorry for the dirty window lol. What an idiot. While at light he started taking off his shirt saying ""come on"". I'm a woman, what was he going to do? He was extremely aggressive and was an Uber driver. I'm sure he picks up a wide variety of people.He is a danger to our community and if you see this man, just know he is incredibly racist and should not be trusted with your safety. I have not had positive experiences with Uber and trying to contact them to report issues is almost impossible. It's too bad people like this are employed by Uber.

"I heard some great things about Uber and when a friend recommended using it, I seen no reason not to give it a try. The trip by cab would have been approximately 50.00 but I was quoted between 26-30 by Uber, so I asked for one. It was a 14.5 mile trip, one way. While waiting, a message came up asking if I wanted to use surge x4. I had no idea what this meant. There was no one to ask and it flashed up so quickly that I just said yes. The Uber then showed up right away and I had no time to deal with this situation. I did ask the driver how much my ride would be and was again quoted 26 to 30.00. Imagine my disgust when the ride was done and I was charged 111.77!!! I couldn't believe it. I had no choice but to pay. I contacted Uber 3 times and they refused to take off the 80.00 SURGE charge. They offered me a 25% discount next ride (Like I will EVER use Uber again!). I have filed a complaint with the BBB and will now go to my bank to refute the charge of 80.00 slapped on. What a ripoff.

I complained to Uber about each driver and only after 3 emails (for each driver) did my complaint actually get read. So I deleted the app and will not use these losers again.

I have a free ride at Uber and wanted to avail it for the first time... The stupid driver cancelled the ride when I was already in it... It was only then when he checked my destination and began to cancel. It was irritating because I'm on a rush. The other thing is he consumed my free and charged the ride I didn't take!

"I would never recommend it to anyone. I had a very bad experience with Uber leasing and I will not suggest anyone to go for it. I thought it's a very good idea to lease it from them. I applied, I got approved, and once again I gave a thought for couple of days to take it or not. Meanwhile I was getting email and text messages from Uber, ""You have a week left. After that you don't get it you need to reapply."" After my days expired I went and asked, and they said, ""We can give it for you,"" and they were so nice while giving the car. They took 250 nonrefundable deposit from me and after 2 days gave me the car.After driving for 1 day the next day it was raining and I was heading home 2 in the morning, and a lady made a sudden U-turn, and crashed into my car and other car. She was at fault. I then contacted Uber through email. They didn't reply at first. Then I contacted the dealer from where I took the car. She says that ""Now it's your car. You leased it and you are responsible for the payments."" I asked her before getting the car. She said, ""If something happens we will take care of it."" I told her the same thing so she said, ""You are responsible for the weekly payments,"" and later I received email from my Uber saying I am responsible for the payments. And they closed my Uber driver account till my car get fixed, and now Uber is only my source of income. I didn't had any other job to do and the lady who hit me had a worst insurance company, and was playing me so I had to go through my insurance company by paying 1000 dollars deductible where I was not having money. Now anyway I have to fix the car. I cannot leave it as it is because it's the lease car. They need it as they gave it to me. I borrowed money from friends and family. When the car got fixed it took almost 7 weeks because of the insurance company and Uber. I lost my Uber weekly income plus 1000 dollar deductibles, plus 1600 Uber lease for 7 weeks, and wage loss for 3000, altogether loss for almost 5600 dollars in 7 weeks only because of Uber.

"Monday evening 08-22-16; Myself, My Husband, Sister and Brother in-law contacted Uber via the mobile App. Upon doing so we were quoted a $80 ride, with possible surge increase. However the app did not in detail describe or calculate the total. So I agreed with ignorance assuming that it could not be more than a few extra bucks. Later informed by Uber that their Uber drivers were in ""High Demand"", however that isn't something I would know so I cannot say why the surge was even there? I don't travel to the city often or for that matter do so during large events. Upon traveling from N. Clark to the western suburb of Lombard, IL. Not only did our Uber driver Victor take a longer route than what we suggested, he then charged us a whopping $300.27 for the ride. That's a 3.9% increase against the normal rate. I cannot say how that is even feasible, how that is even logical or where they could calculate such an amount. I have more than enough Tweets, Facebook messages, Uber communications, Instagram posts noting that they scammed me out of this money. From an ex-Uber driver responding to my Instagram photo she claimed this is a normal practice and they are well aware of this scam and allow it to continue. I have a family of 6.

Uber explains the fee as a necessity to reduce operating costs. Why is that my problem? When you are in business you have operating costs. If you don't want these costs don't be in business. Sucking it your customers is as low a tactic as you can employ.Additionally, Uber now has surge times that increases the ride price. Uber claims that the demand for rides during those surge times are greater than the amount of drivers they have available. Not only is this too not my problem, the explanation doesn't even make sense. Personally I see it as yet another devious way for Uber to suck it to its customers. Uber also claims that their drivers get paid very little and make more money with surge prices. If Uber compensated their drivers properly instead of keeping most of the money for themselves, there wouldn't be this problem. This is nothing more but greed on Uber's end.Three days ago I ordered a ride, the driver cancelled, yet I got charged $5.00. I requested a new ride. Somehow I got the same driver again. Again she cancelled, again I got charged $5.00. That same day Uber charged me yet another $5.00 later in the day under the same driver's name for a ride I never requested. It's taken me 3 whole days for Uber to refund me $10.00. The last $5.00 they charged was supposedly refunded in ride credits. Today I requested an Uber ride. I paid full price. There were no ride credits in my account. Uber may have a great idea but the company is greedy and doesn't care about its customers or drivers. It just cares about its own bottom line. That company sucks!",1.0,0

My wife took UBER with my 3 years old son from MALDEN MA to EAST BOSTON MA to a clinic. When they get there my son throw up a little bit. He only drinks milk. He does not eat any food and even his doctor knows that he does not eat any food so my wife grab some baby wipes and clean most of it but the driver was rushing her and he told her DON'T WORRY. He never told my wife that she will end up paying anything.After my wife came home and check she find out they charged her 168$. We contacted uber and the driver had lied. Maybe he told them it was too much damage. It's a baby puke. A baby that only drinks milk so how big do you think it was?? They told us they charged 18$ for the fare and 150$ for the baby puke. This company hire crooks. The driver was from MOROCCO and why he told my wife DON'T WORRY and never told her it will be a charge and even if they charge for that isn't 150$ too much money? I am taking uber and the driver to the court because to me its a scam and I dont want this to happen to other people. They should hear from both sides not only their crook driver. We will never ride with this crook company that hired thieves as drivers.,1.0,0
"I have had nothing, but trouble dealing with UBER customer service. The only way to contact them is by email since there is NO phone number. Also, you get a reply from a different person each time you reply to an email. The UBER app became usable after a recent Android update, and this caused me to miss a meeting. UBER told me to just reload the app, use a desktop UBER app, download their app from their site instead of Google Play and finally said they fixed it but gave me no way to test it. I have now unloaded my UBER app and loaded LYFT, and they even paid me $50 for my first five rides, where UBER gave me nothing grief!",1.0,0
"I use my cards all over the world and have relied on taxis. My friends were telling me to try Uber so I did. The driver was great. However my payment wasn't accepted. The only customer service is by email which is more annoying than an IVR system. You get a response but you can tell it is either automated with the just the names changed or it is a copy and paste. There is no customer in their service. It's like speaking to a robot. I normally don't work with any company that doesn't have a customer service phone number and display it on their website, but I tried Uber because of the recommendations. After a couple of back and forth emails, they finally asked me to send photocopies of documents which further annoyed me. I probably won't use Uber again. I will take a taxi.",1.0,0

"I was an Uber driver for five months. I became slighted over their referral program. Basically, you share your link with people you want to refer. After their 20th ride the driver receives the referral pay. The first person I referred Uber claimed that the person did not use my referral code. The person told them that she signed up through my link. This was how she found out about Uber. That was the first incident in which I just chucked up the loose. Next, I referred my Godchild. I received a notice that she had completed her 20 rides and I would be getting a payment. This was in February. I checked my account and even called my bank to verify the funds. The funds were not in my account. It is now July. I have been sending correspondence back and forth and this situation has yet to be resolved. I have three emails claiming they will put a trace on the money and someone will contact me in 7 days. The 7 days pass and when I send an email I receive a reply saying the issue has been resolved. Do not trust these people. They have proved to be liars. I have disconnected my account with Uber and I am no longer interested in their company.",1.0,0
I was quoted $17 and when I entered the car the driver added a seat which raised my fare. He then did the same to the passenger who shared my ride. He denied it both times. Uber simply responded to me that I would be given a quote before entering which I was and still doesn't resolve my issue. The driver is scamming passengers. They don't track how often he is doing this?!?,1.0,0
"A friend and I took Uber from Murfreesboro, Tennessee to Nashville for a concert. When the concert was over, got on app for a ride back. It was 8.7 times normal rate.

"Most of customers are complaining about drivers being unprofessional because they passed nearby customer when the driver just received the request. The real thing is that Drivers are not responsible for SOFTWARE ISSUES!!! Uber is responsible for that. Uber need to adjust the software for server to pick up riders 3-4 minutes before arriving near customer, but because the programmers are following the UBER RULE to be aggressive taking very fast the customers, they cant solve real problems to pick up customers in a right order so no one cant mistake anything!! Like in a dual carriageway, server dont think that you need to turn around. You should stop calling drivers unprofessional, they just doing they job, they dont programming the app like you wanted. Start think before blame drivers from UBER. Uber drivers some are so professional that they even can go to Formula 1 tournament because they are really amazing on they driving skills. Next time try to think outside the box and see the real problem. For example you're sitting in a big roundabout, how you explaining the driver cant reach you if he just received request in the middle of roundabout with red lights and 5 lanes? He cant, he will cancel the trip and you will blame him being fault. He is not fault of systems errors, and that's it.",3.0,1
Uber has charged my account for a ride that I did not even take. It was 4 a.m. Central Time and I was home asleep. Fair warning to all Uber users write down each and every time you request a ride and then match it with your checking account or credit card.,1.0,0
"I am upset that my 16-year-old son was allowed to ride Uber without my consent and without being accompanied by an adult. This occurred last night, Saturday, July 9, 2016. Why didn't any of the drivers check his ID. He looks every bit of 15. I see this as a problem because someone's child could be meeting up with a predator and end up dead somewhere... run away from home, etc. Nashville has got to do better and not just be concerned about making money. Be concerned about child safety.",1.0,0
"When I signed up for Uber I remember specifically asking the rep about damage and accidents. His reply was and I quote. ""Don't worry bro. If your app is on and you have an Uber rider in the vehicle, we got you covered. We have an insurance company that handles all that."" I forget the guy's name. He was just one of dozens of people working at the busy little Uber sign up and inspection office. Well, guess what, my car WAS damaged while I had Uber riders in my car. They are Uber riders are they not? I am ""contracted"" by Uber to transport their customers? I know they refuse to call me and hundreds of thousands of other drivers ""employees"" but they can't deny that the riders are ""theirs"".So I live in Las Vegas, NV. And every once in a while we unfortunately get a few inches of rain, in a very short period of time which causes the city to flood. So I happen to be driving during one of these times and had ""Uber riders"" going to one of the worst pick up/ drop off areas on the strip. Under the Linq hotel and Casino in their tour bus pick up and drop off area (as it is the same with many of the other hotels.) there is a raging river of sorts coming in the direction of where I need to go to drop the riders off. I ask the hotel security guard directing traffic. ""Hey where can I drop off my ""Uber riders""? He just smiles and points up past the raging river of water, and says, ""You know where the drop-off and pick-up area is."" Well it's not that deep and I see other cars driving up, so I follow.Well about half way up, another security guard is motioning to me, so I roll down my window. ""Hey a piece of your bumper is hanging off your car man.""...Confused I shout back. ""WHAT???"" He yells again. ""A piece of your bumper is hanging off your car."" Still confused I proceed to the drop-off area a dozen or so more feet away from me. The riders get out and I pull over out of the water. Sure as **, there is a large piece of my bumper or ground effects. (I have a custom ground effects package on my car.) The bottom portion that covers my exhaust tips is torn off and hanging by a small sliver of plastic. I pick it up and, the piece easily comes off and I throw it in my trunk. It's late so I go home and try to figure out what to do to get this damage reported and taken care of.I ask the security person about a report. He says the police won't come because no one was hurt and it's on hotel property. And If I want a statement from him, I have to go through the Hotel security office...Ok...helpful. I go home and type away on my Uber app in the field that says, ""I had an accident."" I go through their questions and take the pictures and hit submit. Easy enough. My car is still drivable and safe. The damage is just cosmetic. So I go to turn the app on in the evening to drive for Uber again. Can't log in. Says ""Your account has not been activated."" WHAT??? I've got almost 200 rides. What do you mean it's not been activated.Well, come to find out. Uber deactivated my app. They never told me why, just an apology the next day and a 55 dollar credit to my account for the potential loss of money I encountered. (Later I find out that they suspended my account on the fact that I did not send them a particular document related to the accident.) Oh and they called the riders by the way. Because the riders still had my phone number since they were my last ride. I don't know the manner of questions they asked but the riders did verify that they were in the car and the damage had occurred and was legit. (I'm assuming because the insurer for Uber a James River Insurance Co.) acknowledged my claim as legit and was working up an estimate of the amount of damage to my car. I've included some of the correspondence.They estimated the damage to be around 617 dollars. Lol what a joke. That's not even close. It would be in the thousand to two thousand dollar range because the piece just can't be glued back on. It would have to be replaced and it's part of the entire back piece which in itself cost around 500 dollars and that's just for the piece, not the freight, and then the labor of getting it put on. But I knew I wasn't going to win that argument, so I was just going to take their estimate. So following day, some schmo by the name of Trevor ** calls me and leaves a message for me to call him back with a claim number to reference the phone call. I do, he informs me that even though my claim is valid and the damage is legit, they are not going to give me a dime for any repairs because there is a 1000.00 dollar deductible on this ""particular"" plan.Yes, you heard me boys and girls. A 1000.00 that's ONE THOUSAND dollar deductible that YOU THE DRIVER is responsible for if damage occurs to YOUR vehicle while an UBER passenger is in your car and it is damaged or in an accident. So, Trevor informs me that ""Since the estimate of damage is under the 1000.00 dollar deductible, there is nothing we can do for you at this time."" Uber is worth BILLIONS with a capital B and they won't pay for the 617 dollars worth of estimated damage to my car??? Just know this drivers, (contractors of UBER) they are full of crap, they don't care about YOU the driver, they don't car about anything other than the ridiculous amount of money they make preying on unsuspecting, uninformed, drivers like you and me.I wrote them afterward and told them about what the insurance company said, and that they've made more on me or would make more than they estimated. 617 in damage if I got it repaired and stayed a driver for Uber. But guess what, they don't give a crap about you. I included the letter in which they say as much. And it seems that half of the time you deal with customer service for UBER, you get a foreigner because it's outsourced to India and the other half, I get an American whom replies to me. One letter it's JON, the next, it's JABARRI. So, now I'm screwed, I've gotten damage that was according to them, a legit, meaning I met all the qualifications to be a legit claim and they still weaseled their way out of it by claiming a 1000 dollar deductible.Ever notice on your way bills, on the very bottom it says get a ""certificate of Insurance."" Press that button and it's a certificate of liability insurance. Try to enlarge it. Because it is TINY and you can't enlarge it on your phone. Do it on your computer at home and read it. That's just for the liability. Now call them and ask what your financial responsibilities are if you were to get into an accident or receive damage to your car while transporting a rider. Tell them that you are recording the conversation for your records also. See what they say to you. Uber is a money hungry shady company doing backroom deals and paying out as little as they can to operate as a transportation company, because that's really what they are. They need to be regulated. Call or write you local congressman or senator. I plan too.Notice too, if the picture downloaded that in the estimate paper they sent me, where it says deductible, it states UNKNOWN. They also had me submit a picture of my Declarations page of my own insurance policy. Why? IF they were the insurance provider on a legit claim, why do they need my dec sheet? Sorry, the pictures won't be downloaded because I have to turn the computer off and then back on. But the documents were of the letter the insurance co. gave me for the est. the pictures of the damage to my car. Well they just ignited a one man crusade. If I could give them no stars I would. I'm never driving for them again and I will be asking Lyft these insurance questions as well.Luckily I only do this a couple of hours a week because I have a full-time job so it won't hurt me too badly. They rely on that fact to stay in business. The fact that some people quit their full-time jobs and do Uber full-time, so it gives them a ""no choice but to keep driving situation."" Uber is not an honest company. I learned that the hard way. I will now be telling my story to the local politicians that are fighting Uber here in Nevada politically. If this is fuel for their cause, so be it. I'm sorry for the people that rely on this horrible company for their living. They will ** you one way or another.",1.0,0

"Absolutely unethical and unfair to drivers. I drove with Uber for almost two years and am ready to delete my App and switch to Lyft. I have clear evidence (screenshots) of multiple occasions where I picked up riders in 1.8 or over surge zone but was paid regular fare. Their regular fare is so low that almost 50% of my trips are under $5 each after Uber fee deduction... Such a joke. No one would let you sit in your car for $3 or something, let alone driving for 1-2 miles to pick the person, drive them another 2-3 miles, spend about 10 minutes of your time and get paid $5 or less... Not to mention that kind of people you end up dealing with, from drug possessing people to those carrying their stupid McDonald burgers into your car, which you then have to drive your car for miles with windows open to get rid of the smell. Driving for Uber is like selling your car in bits and prices. You are not making money, instead each time you pick up a rider, you are giving away a piece of your car by depreciating its value.

Uber lies about their incentives. For example they say $50 an hour for Lake Tahoe driving. The terms are you have to complete one ride per hour at least. However they will not give you one ride per hour. The only thing they want is more driver in that City. You will not get the $50 because they don't give you one ride per hour. They just want more driver so it will be available when customers request.,1.0,0
I took an Uber from Downtown Manhattan to Port Authority (42nd & 8th Ave.) and it costs $50!!! Are you kidding me right now!!!

Because the base fare is $7.00 and then $13.16 for 3.51 miles and then $31.51 for the 49 minutes that I wasted in the damn car. Grand total $51.67. Never again...

"Up until 2 days ago, I had been an Uber partner for over a year and must say their practices are very questionable. 1st point, DRIVERS. How can a company claim they do ""background"" checks, and on countless occasions have the drivers be a bunch of menacing idiots, providing questionable rides in even more questionably safe cars, all the while being more focused on his/her phone conversation than the road. SERIOUSLY?! Now if these checks were, in fact, being done, then why the battle for not allowing drivers to be fingerprinted? It's an honest question, and quite frankly, a legit one. You claim your drivers are safe, but are unwilling to back that up with something so simple as fingerprinting?! LET THE BUYER BEWARE! 2nd point, GRATUITY. You tell the public that gratuity is included, and is not necessary. Okay, fine, but if a rider wishes to give a little extra to a driver for going that extra mile (no pun intended), you insist to the driver to NOT ACCEPT. First off people, the BIG CLUE here would be in THEIR WORDS, ""TIPPING IS INCLUDED."" How can you 'include' something that the rider may or may not even want to do, let alone a price that would be set by someone other than themselves.Secondly, I'm quite sure there is some sort of legality here, because how can you justify doing this without allowing the rider the option of opting out of said ""included tip."" Kind of how you can do this at restaurants... which by the way are usually parties of 8 or more. And thirdly, why, on the itemized receipts, was there no listing of what said gratuity was? It listed everything else from, how long the trip was, to what the surge pricing was (if applicable) but not that. It's because, yet again, Uber not only lied to its riders but simultaneously screwed its rideshare partners. It's because it NEVER WAS INCLUDED. In fact, just recently, Uber settled a $100 million lawsuit on this very subject, and STILL refuses to add a spot on the app for a gratuity option for riders. 3rd point, INCENTIVES. This will be short, because there aren't any. No real motivation for any driver, anywhere, to give their VERY BEST. For me, giving my best was easy, because I wanted to regardless of the circumstances. However, with others, that's the only reason to do so. And it's because of that, that I would hear story, after story, about how my riders ""last"" experience was so horrible which makes me look bad too.And finally my 4th point, EMPLOYEE OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. Uber Partners get 1099'd, use their own car, pay their own fuel, clean their own cars, pay for their own repairs which clearly indicates INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR, but when you start NOT accepting rides you get bombarded with cute emails warning you of deactivation, clearly indicating EMPLOYEE. How can you dictate what I can and cannot take, and still call us INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS?! The answer is you can't. Which is why I have taken my natural gifts, as a decent human being, and have been GIVING MY ALL to Lyft. Lyft is a WAY better company to work for. They offer incentives to drivers and riders alike. They do a more thorough background check on drivers (the evidence of this one is simply not every Uber Partner can become a Lyft Partner, even though both do independent background checks. Interesting huh. Not everyone knows that), and even rider and driver support is actually personable. Not to mention, when was the last time you heard ANY negative situation on the news about a Lyft driver? I have yet to hear one. All in all, Lyft maybe the smaller of the 2, but they are growing, and growing the SMART way considering QUALITY over QUANTITY. Sure Lyft, at times, maybe SLIGHTLY more but consider the QUALITY you will be getting. To all the readers of this post, PLEASE consider the switch to Lyft, if you haven't already. Don't let MINIMAL PRICE DIFFERENCE be the deciding factor when choosing a mode of transportation that you expect to get you and your loved ones around.

"I have been an Uber driver for a few months now. Uber drivers beware. If you have a rider who is going to get sick in your car, get them out of your vehicle as quickly as possible. Uber does not protect you against damages to your vehicle and getting them to get reimbursement for damage to your vehicle is like pulling teeth. One of my riders got sick in my vehicle. First I tried to download the pictures to their app under ""My rider damaged my vehicle..."" The app doesn't allow me to download. I had to go down to the Uber Center location because Uber doesn't have any over the phone representatives to support you when damage occurs. Once the representative at one of their sites and after I submitted documented receipts of the damages to repair my vehicle, I was reimbursed at 60% of what I had to pay to get repaired??? Cannot tell you how disappointing it was to send so many back and forth messages to UBER and the pictures and receipt proof only to be stiffed by UBER. Please know that UBER can care less about your vehicle or you. They only want to get their fare money. Anything else they have to do for you is a hassle to them. My suggestion is next time a rider of yours feels sick, pull over and kick them out of your car and let them know UBER doesn't support their drivers.",1.0,0
"In my opinion, Uber does not live up to the ethical standards they claim to have and does not respect their customers. I will avoid Uber to the best of my ability going forward and have moved to using Lyft which is much better. Here’s my experience: I left very nice expensive speakers on the back seat of his Uber and sent an email to Uber later that day which said I should contact the driver.I called the driver the next day and he said he’d drop the speakers off in the parking lot. I thought he meant the parking lot in front of my house where he picked me up originally but he meant a parking lot next to Chase bank? How was I supposed to assume this parking lot? I waited in my parking lot and he never showed. I had things to do so I figured it could wait and called back the next morning. We then agreed to meet at the parking lot next to Chase at 11 and that I’d call him when I’m over there. I went to the parking lot and he wasn’t there so I called several times from 11-1120. He finally picked up and told me he was busy. I called back at about 1215 and he said he was in the parking lot so I told him I’d be there in 5 min. I showed up and he wasn’t there so I called several times over the next 10 minutes and he never answered.Thus, I reported this incident to Uber corporate and Uber corporate says he told them he doesn’t have any speakers. Uber told me that they would help with police inquiries. I told Uber corporate to let him know that I would file a police report if he didn’t return my speakers in 24 hours. I called the driver the next morning and he changed his story on me and told me what he was trying to tell me is that he didn’t find any speakers even though he said he had them and could drop them off? I asked why did he tell me he had them and he said something like “Why would I want your speakers?” Therefore, I filed a police report that night and the police called him through Uber a couple times and he hung up on the police twice. This happened a few months ago and Uber has not offered anything to attempt to make things right after I contacted them several times.",1.0,0

I received a mail stating that I have earned free ride of 125/-. I then booked a cab in Uber but when I reached my destination I was charged the whole amount. I opened the app after paying the driver and saw there was no free rides available for me whereas day before yesterday I saw 6 free rides which were not expired also. I immediately mailed to customer help and they replied that I have misused my account to get a free ride. This is ridiculous. In free ride option in the main menu it's written if we want free rides then refer a friend and we will be rewarded with a free ride and after doing so they are saying I have misused the service and the system cannot detect the situation and my rides were cancelled. It's clear that there is something wrong in the system and due to which we suffer. The customer service is very poor they don't reply to the mails.

Uber ONLY pays a driver while the rider is having the ride to their destination. The IRS values every mile you ride in your car at about 55 cents. That is the cost for gas and wear and tear on your vehicle. Then comes the driving you do to the point where your rider is; and after you drop your rider off to the next rider. Uber does not reimburse a cent for that. So your actual revenue is less than 20 cents per mile. That could be about 2.00 dollars per hour. It's way less than minimum federal wage.I learned also about the surge price during peak hours. The rider suffers that and the driver never gets to see a fraction of that money. I urge people to please don't waste your money and your automobiles to do a job which is making someone else rich. Call your friends to drive you around or a taxi. Please understand that you’re risking your personal property as well as your safety too! That is with the consideration of being paid so little. I've actually read about some drivers who were charged by Uber. What in the world! Stop this CRIME.",1.0,0
"I called Uber this morning to schedule a pick-up. When the driver arrived, the name on his I.D. was different from the name given me during scheduling. He said he needed to have payment in cash ($8.00). As I was going to be late for a doctor's visit, I paid him the cash. Uber then charged my bank account for the fare. I have tried to reach Uber numerous times, numerous ways, with no response. A customer service phone number instructs me to contact them online. Their website suggests I sign-in to report an issue, but when I hit the button to do so, I get a note that says ""Page Not Found"". Horrible, unreliable service and drivers... too good to be true.",1.0,0
"On April 9, 2016 at 1:00 am I requested a car from lower Manhattan to Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn which is a long ride. I watched as the map showed the car getting closer and only 1 minute away. I waited for another 10 minutes but the driver never showed. Then the driver canceled the ride. I tried again and another car was coming and never showed. Also the app showed the driver around the corner a minute away. After 10 more minutes I canceled. My friend who was with me requested a car from lower Manhattan to the Upper East Side in Manhattan and guess what, the driver showed. Uber charged me two cancellation fees and I had to take the subway at 1:30 am for an hour and a half to Brooklyn.Uber customer service would not understand that the drivers dodged my requests so they would not have to go to Brooklyn and they insisted I was impatient. I think waiting 30 minutes was enough for a car parked one minute away. So the drivers suck, the service sucks and customer service sucked. Until I tried to cancel my account. I did get my money back.",1.0,0

Now trying to reapply with Uber and I'm getting the run's. Even the referred driver I invited now after they completed the required 50 trips they told me that the driver didn't meet a requirement but which requirement? They won’t list nor directly tell me also why my background isn't going through. Would never again refer anymore contacts to this faults lying. No real contact by landline place to anyone.

"I have noticed in the past months a serious decline in Uber service. Drivers are incredibly unprofessional. For example, today I was late to work so I requested an Uber. A driver accepted my request and the app showed he was just 3 minutes away. As I am waiting, I see the car move away from my location instead of closer. I call the driver, who tells me he is coming around. After waiting another 8 minutes, and seeing he is indeed coming around, he suddenly- and for no reason - cancels the trip when he is just a half block away. I called him and he didn't pick up the phone. I submitted a complaint to Uber but nobody got in touch with me. If I have cancelled a trip 5 minutes after requesting it, I would have been charged. In this occasion, I not only was late to work but nobody offered any compensation or apology. This is not the only time I've had an experience like this. Uber should hold their drivers accountable for such behaviour. I only hope that competitors would show up to offer a better and more reliable service.",1.0,0
"Noticed activity on my iPhone today saying that my Uber ride was en route - well that was interesting as I was working from home and had not called Uber so I cancelled it without thinking anything was wrong. Went to drive my car to yoga and a new message comes up about my Uber driver is en route! Now I am curious so I go into my account and see that there were several rides since midnight - one for nearly $500. the interesting part was they were in Detroit and I am in Atlanta and had not been to Detroit in over six months and I always rent a car when there. In any case I send a message that I think there has been fraudulent activity and briefly explain what is going on - no response nothing! So I call the driver that is supposedly picking me up and tell him that I am in ATL that this is a fraudulent ride - he hangs up on me. I cancel that ride. I send another message to Uber saying fraudulent activity as the guy I just spoke to went on another ride - this time for over $100. Still nothing from Uber. So now I send a message about the issue I had with the ride saying fraudulent activity. They send me a note saying issue resolved and here's $5 for not being satisfied with my ride!! Really??! Now I have to spend 20 minutes on the phone with American Express going through all my Uber rides to say which ones are valid and which ones are fraudulent. There is no phone number for customers to reach out for this type of behavior. Their customer service is horrible and quite frankly, I wonder how safe we are as passengers with the caliber or lack thereof of people who are driving - what kind of background checks are these drivers put through??

"The initial fare was almost double what the return fare cost and this was done to cover the ""free ride"" discount! The distance varied by 2 miles, also, to and from my appointment. I used Uber in the Morning of May 25, 2016 to take a ""12.86"" mile trip (which was actually shown to be 9.86 miles) for an appointment. I was not told the price at all so there was no disclosure made. I was promised an discounted ride I signed up. This is an Unfair Trade Practice, and it is a Bait & Switch tactic. I believe that the FTC and the U.S. Dept of Consumer Protection should investigate Uber. There may be cause to impose fines and/or imprisonment.

"This past Friday, May 13, 2016 at 4:40 p.m., I wanted to try the new UBER app to order a car. It was raining and I am disabled. I followed all the instructions on the APP 1. pickup location 224 West 57 Street & Broadway 2) destination, Sheepshead Bay Brooklyn. etc. and they sent me the name of the driver and you can see how far away he is from your location. I was waiting for the price of the ride which I thought should be automatically; some kind of confirmation number so I can have the option to not accept the car. The driver came and I figured he would know, as soon as I told him where I had to go, he was complaining that the trip was too far, a lot of traffic for Friday and it is raining. I asked him how much is the ride. He had no idea, but he kept saying to me it is an estimated price. There is no set price. That was not what I expected, so I asked what will the estimate be he said up to $200.00 due to the rain, heavy traffic. I couldn't believe what he told me. He literally threw me out of the cab. I said to drop me off at 57 Street & 7th Ave. because I was not going to pay such a fee. So by the time I was on the train I checked my bank account and UBER Charged me for a ride that I didn't take for $139.00. If I took any yellow cab, it would have been no more than $60 to $80 dollars. There is no way to reach them by phone, no specific person to e-mail to, just a support service. No mailing address, now they disconnected my cell phone off the app so I can't see if they reviewed my ride. I was robbed of $139.00 by this company. If you can let the public know about what happened to me, I would be very glad. At this point I don't know what else to do. I guess this is capitalism at work, start up a company with no control, and the drivers can do whatever they want. I am so upset.",1.0,0
"I took a 13.00 fare to pick up a car for my company. I had all of my stuff, which included 2 phones. As soon as the driver left I realized I forgot 1 of the phones which I with android device manager while emailing both he and Uber support 7 times each over the course of the next hour. The driver answered his phone once and obviously knew I was calling about my phone as the Uber automated system tells him that when it auto calls. He hung up and then did not answer again for another hour. Uber responded back with ""wait a while"". After the hour of trying I texted and left a VM that simply said, ""I know you have my phone because I can see it on GPS, please call me back."" Well this moron obviously is not aware of gps technology and probably figured he was caught so he called me back. The conversation was unintelligible as he repeated over and over that he wasn't in my city any longer and couldn't get right back. I mentioned that he was in the city the first hour I called, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt - I understand a passenger leaving an item is a bit of a pain in the ass for a driver. My plan was to throw him some cash for his trouble and I even offered for him to put on the meter for his time up and back home to expedite the process. He said in 30 mins from that time he would be on the way. 5 more emails to Uber with all this info - response - ""can you be more specific"". After another hour I call and his phone is now straight to VM and has been ever since. My phone has also turned off either due to battery or the idiot driver. Still not even a whisper from Uber.To add insult to injury - I am an Uber driver!!! I would never do this to someone. I don't understand what type of person would jeopardize their ability to earn income over a cell phone. You can make that money in a couple of hours. With that said, it's obvious that Uber has no standards regarding their drivers, so they probably won't ever make contact or penalize him. They probably are creating a new service called ""Uber hot"" where they sell off all the items that get left behind and the drivers get a cut. I don't have the ability to give 0 stars, but that is definitely my recommendation. I am totally grossed out with the level of concern I received from Uber, which is ZERO. MY only hope at this point is that karma repays them both for being total scumbags.",1.0,0
"The truth is that Uber sucks. What we need is serious improvement on the taxi system rather than replacing it with a gigantic corporation that has way, waaay too much power in a unregulated market. Uber is too big to be controlled and that is a serious threat workers and consumers. I had an important medical appointment yesterday. I'm being treated with scheduled shots for a serious medical condition. The Uber driver who was supposed to pick me up cancelled the trip because of surging prices. Each and every time I tried to get an Uber car it was the same thing. The app showed the car arriving in a few minutes, but you could see the car taking turns and driving around to have me cancelling the trip and allowing him to make more money on another trip due to surging rates. It has happened many times in the past and the internet is full of negative reviews stating the very same problem, which I've heard from friend in Brazil as well.Uber automated customer service is designed to look like a real person is responding to the endless number of complaints and taking no action. After a few passionate messages from my end, Uber sent me 5 dollars as a refund. Refund for what? That did not prevent the problem from happening again. In essence it fixes nothing and aggravates me even more. Be aware of the scam! Uber is not cheaper than a cab. This is simply not true. In addition, making a video to be watched online is not training drivers. This claim that drivers are better prepared than regular cab drivers is pure **.I've been picked up in Miami by a driver who was riding with her mother on the passenger's seat. I nearly lost my flight as the driver had the nerve to stop at a Walgreens to buy snacks and got lost on her way to the airport. You may argue that it is the driver's fault. Not Uber's. Well, this is another reason why a multi-billion dollar corporation is scamming the world without being held accountable for anything. You did not use the driver's app. You contract Uber and the company does nothing for you when things go wrong. Don't help drivers in trouble, don't help consumers being disrespected. Be aware of the scam! I'm never using Uber again. Have asked repeatedly to have my account deleted and guess what? They haven't claiming that they will do it at their own terms. What the heck does that mean? It's my account. Why they have to have a say on it? Rejection junkies? I think not. Corporate greed on its best. Be aware!",1.0,0

Driver never notified me of this policy or garage us a warning and drove us. Later on Uber decided to ""up charged"" due to extra passenger.

"I have been using them for a while and it was great. However, recently I noticed that they are charging me at their own free wish and disregard my numerous concern or question to help. These are some of my observation on my recent use: App shows they are 1 minute away, so you click on them to pick you, then they won't show off until 15 to even 30 minutes (in freezing cold winter, snowy or rainy days).If you cancel them to order another cab (since they don't show off, and they don't pick up phone after 15 or 30 minutes), then they charge you $5 anyways for cancellation fees, regardless of the driver's behavior, or corrupted system they have designed to charge people. So basically, they make you wait and wait under sunshine or cold weather and you are stuck with them to show off no matter how long it might take! Customers don't matter at all.We got charged with the wrong address and wrong timing. In other word, they sent me invoice with incorrect timing and direction (than what it was in fact). This so happened when using Uber with colleagues, so everyone got to know how corrupted and careless they are. Robbery in daylight! One driver threw me out in snowy cold icy day and in the middle of a large puddle of mud!!! He cared less and just wanted to rush to the next $$!I shared my concerns - especially being charged incorrectly by them/drivers - no luck so far! they care less! I do have pictures of my conversation with the driver (time is documented in the text msg, along with our concern of freezing weather and that we are out off the street waiting on him!), along with the receipt of being charged by Uber/driver falsely (with incorrect time of dire) to add couple of $ more!

"I have been in business for myself for over 30 years and started driving for Uber at the behest of my wife and daughter, who thought I would have fun driving for them. I told them that I thought it was ridiculous to treat your personal car as a cab hauling people around with all costs of operation including risk on your own back, then UBER taking 25% plus riders fee as their take for virtually doing nothing except using their software. A truly incredible business model though...for them to get rich, not you...ever. No one was ever able to explain to me if it actually made dollar sense to drive, so I took a one month part time challenge driving 70 hours total on some weekdays and some weekends. Don't believe the liars who say they make $1,500 a week or more. They would have to work non-stop to even come close, and even then, the other costs that Uber takes and the cost of maintenance, insurance, gas, etc. would make that evaporate. Based on AAA costs of operating a motor vehicle for a mid-sized four-door sedan driving 20,000 per year (you will double that with Uber) the cost is at $0.48 per mile which includes gas, maintenance, insurance, depreciation, financing (unless you own outright) tire wear and tear, and several other factors. I did long airport runs and short city runs (longer runs make more $) and drove 2,142 miles over 3 1/2 weeks in April 2016 making a total after Uber cuts of $1,076.82. The AAA based that $0.48 on $2.85 gas which is more like $2.00 now, so take that into account now which would put operating costs today at 30% lower for FUEL ONLY and not the other expenses, so let's put it at $0.42 instead of $0.48. This is pretty simple math, so look at the facts. Instead of $1,030 cost to operate at driving 2,142 miles it will be $900 because of $2.00 gas. I made $1,076.82 before taxes and my operating costs were $900 giving me a net total of $176.82 for 70 hours of work. Now my car is paid off and will have lower depreciation, but that is about $2.53 per hour after expenses if your car is newer and not paid off. They tout you can make $16-$20-$30 an hour. In the REAL world you are actually making $1.60-$2.00-$3.00 per hour. I hope this helps people who have never been in business and who UBER and LYFT and any other companies out there that take advantage of others to get rich. These people will win in the end though and will be laughing all the way to the Bahamas when the scam runs to the end. Hope this helps anyone who does not just want to do this for fun, but thinks you can pay your bills with this ""job"".",2.0,0
"I have been using Uber religiously for 2-3 months now. Everyone had bad things to say about not trusting them, but because I had mostly good experiencing I defended them, UNTIL! They started to charge you however they feel, the app says if you cancel 5 mins after you've requested, you get charged, fair enough! But I have requested and wasn't happy with my wait time and cancelled within seconds and was charged. On 3 occasions this happened, fortunately they credit back my account. Once, a driver cancelled on me because he PREFERRED a trip to downtown Toronto, I got charged for that. They refunded it too after I disputed it.I've have complained way too many times about the wait times, 15-20 mins in my bust area because the pro of driver's flexibility is also a con, because they work when they want to which decreases the reliability of an Uber when needed. Today was my last straw with Uber because I can only imagine when they get the full 100 from the city to carry on with their business fully without taxi drivers complaining. I requested my Uber as normal and got my wait time of 11 mins, that's fine, 5 mins before my driver arrive they send me notice that my surge price is 1.3. I NEVER ACCEPTED SURGE PRICE. I screen shot this immediately and send to them. They start to explain surge pricing and how it works. I KNOW HOW IT WORKS! I've used it many times! They refuse to refund me, mind you, had I cancel that trip, I would of been charged $5 because they sent way past 5 mins.My two cents, stick to regular taxi's because (1) You can depend on Uber when drivers decide to work they want. You'll be late to your destination; (2) If it's raining or snowing or the Sun is too HOT, drivers do not want to come out unless the price is surged, which means you end up waiting 5-10 mins and you pay the price you would pay for a regular cab. The point of a cab is reliability when time is against you. Uber removes that when their drivers work when they want and only in extreme condition when the price is surged.",1.0,0
"I've been using Uber regularly for about a year now. I have had only positive experiences so far, except for one instance when a driver tried to scam me. She accepted my request, and a minute or so later, the app status suddenly changed to ""on trip."" I thought this was very strange and assumed perhaps there was a glitch or maybe the driver had accidentally hit the wrong button, so I canceled and requested again. I was connected to the same driver, but surely enough the app said I was on my way after a few moments. Again, I wanted to give my driver the benefit of the doubt and I chalked it up to the fact that I haven't updated Uber yet. However, I noticed that her car was starting to move along the route toward my destination. Interesting. I thought maybe she was trying to turn somewhere, but she just kept going, and it became clear that she was going to take me where I wanted to go without me in the car at all.So I immediately canceled that ride. A few minutes later I got emails showing that I'd been charged for both ""trips."" So I used Uber's Help tool to dispute the charges, and fortunately, after just a few minutes I was refunded once with my actual money and once with Uber credit. So I'm at least glad that I immediately got my refund.So, yeah, take from this what you will. Uber is generally safe and reliable, but like in any field or profession, there are going to be some bad people. The best thing you can do is be aware of the kinds of scams drivers may try to pull, including: planting fake vomit in the car and having you charged for it, Not ending the ride after you arrive at your destination, so the app continues to charge you after you've exited the car, Claiming you had multiple other passengers in the vehicle with you so they can charge extra, Starting the ""trip"" without picking you up.It seems like Uber has gotten better about addressing complaints and issuing refunds, so that's good, but it helps to be aware that these things can happen. The sooner you report it, the better. But after dozens of rides in the past year that were perfectly fine, I'm still very satisfied with my service. All of the other drivers I've had have been at the very least pleasant, and some of them have been exceptionally polite and helpful - I've had many drivers help me unload groceries and carry them to my door, and I've had people pick me up for rides of less than 1 mile when I injured my ankle, even though drivers get paid very little to make small trips like that.So, if you're reading these reviews, please just keep in mind that people usually take to these places to complain, so the results are going to be very skewed toward the negative side. I'm glad that sites like this exist so people CAN complain and warn others when things go wrong, but just take them with a grain of salt.",4.0,1

"My best friend was driving for Uber, mostly on busy nights, when the rates were high, and when the surge area was busy, so I went with her a few times, so she feels safe. They ripped my friend off with her getting paid. Emailed her and said passengers complained and said she seemed intoxicated, and driving too fast, and speeding, which is Not true.So at that time when we had no idea what was going on at that moment, Uber turned off her Uber app, and sender us to another rider's home to pick up for 20 mins or so. At the same time this rider is complaining asking her where she is.

And at the same time she was getting mean comments from this man and overturned off her application. We had no idea what was going on it after we drove all that way, and then we decided to be done for the night because we don't know why that we were at was off and driving all that way back and forth a couple times and getting cussed out from other writers because of uber.Also she's also trying to call them and she couldn't even get a hold of them and they have not even contacted her to tell her any of that information. They only email her. There is no type of business at all. If that's how they work I am never going to use Uber. Also heard that they have a GPS on their phone and they could track every move you make and see what you're doing at all times and know exactly where you are and don't care about what right if it's in the car and rips people's credit cards off. And my friend never got paid for what she did that night and some countless other times. They need to go out of business. You can't even contact them.

"On the evening of 5th April 2016 I called for an Uber car to take me from Dallas/Fort Worth airport to the west side of Fort Worth. I had just come in on a flight from California. Betty showed up in a white Mitsubishi Gallant. She lives in Irving and works the mid-cities area. We traveled to my destination and had pleasant and polite conversation on the way. I sat in the front of the car. Soon after the ride was complete I was informed that my ride was $46.43 which was reasonable for the distance traveled. The next day I received a tag on fee of $200 to cover clean-up of vomit on the front seat of the car. I checked on Google to find that the vomit scam is alive and well and apparently 'Uber Betty' is using this to screw her passengers and boost her income. I was emailed bogus pictures of my vomit.Uber were useless in assisting with this claim as they are all but unable to be contacted. It was PayPal that reversed the charge after I filed a complaint with them. I would urge you that if you use Uber, take photographs of the front and back seats and the license plate of the car to protect yourself from being scammed like I was.

It is completely not logical, follows few if any standards, completely non-intuitive. I seriously wonder if you need to take drugs to understand how to use it. I'm not even joking. Head meds, crack cocaine - something. The website is even worse. The absolutely least user friendly and non-functional website I have ever seen from a company larger than 5 employees. What's up with that? Then, if you get through all of that, which takes a roughly 2 hour learning curve because the app makes no sense until you start trying random things - it only accepts certain KINDS of credit cards. It wants bank cards so it can presumably drain your bank account at will, but rejects secure cards that limit the damage criminal companies like Uber can do. That's nice.Last, there is no explanation anywhere of the terms. You have to scour the web and go to forums unless you can guess the made-up terms they use. I wish New Mexico's G Ride would go national - it is INFINITELY better. I absolutely do not trust Uber, am deleting my credit card info, and keeping a close eye to make sure they don't steal from me because I have absolutely no confidence in them based on their sheer incompetence. Reading the reviews I know I am making a great choice. I'll walk or call a cab.",1.0,0
"I was a driver for Uber. I kept a record of my trip history from, which included the time I received the call for pick-up, the time of pick-up, the time of drop-off and what the mileage was when I picked up and dropped off the rider. When I reviewed my trip history with what Uber paying me for, I discovered that there was substantial difference in mileage that from my car, and Uber is showing. Some trips were short, over 3 miles! Uber refused to pay me for all the discrepancies I showed them. One trip they charged the customer for, but didn't pay me anything! Thank God I kept a detailed record off what I did. I was cheated out of 38 miles of travel. I could go on but I am using a library-timed computer.Updated 4/7/2016 - Just reviewed my pay statement from Uber, and once again, I am totally convinced that they are totally unethical and outright dishonest, putting it lightly. As I stated in my last complaint, there was one ride I wasn't even paid for. I went to Uber last week with my list 16 discrepancies, wherein each discrepancy was about the mileage that I recorded from start to finish, vs what Uber was showing and paying me on. The Uber rep told me, regarding the ride I wasn't paid for, that they charged the customer $25.08, which I noted on my list, and that they would make an adjustment for that, and it would appear on my next statement. However, upon reviewing my pay statement, they are showing that they charged the customer $19.08!! They also completely changed the numbers on another trip that originally showed $9.55 fare down to $5.20! It was showing I would get $7.16 of the $9.55, but now shows only $3.90, based on the revised $5.20 fee! I guess they don't think people screen their pay statements, but I do, and I happened to make a copy of the statement before the numbers were changed, thus I was able to capture how they changed the figures. I really wish someone would audit them and verify if what they are charging the customer, whether they are paying the driver their fair share. Based on what has happened to me, on the trip I had been told what they charged the rider $25.08 and what they put on my statement ($19.08) is absolute proof they are not honest, as well as the other issue.",2.0,0

The second email said if you do not use it you will lose it. So we decided to use it from Hollywood Beach Fl to Miami Beach Fl this past Saturday afternoon. Then our card was charged and it did not have the discount removed from bill. I wrote them since there is no telephone to call. I sent many emails with copies of the promotional email they sent twice. Every response was from different person and each response said that the promotion was already used in Nov 2015 for my account. I wrote how can that be when the two emails from your Company were dated Feb 18 2016 and March 21 2016? No response except to repeat that we do not get the $20 off this charge.I will never trust them again. Besides the driver would not get out of the car to help with the two grocery boxes that we had purchased in the store. During the trip the car was hot and aircon was not cooling. On arrival home the driver again would not get out of the car to help with the boxes. I am a disabled senior and had to put one box on the street and carry one to the front of the building and someone was just about to take the box when he saw me. That is a horrible experience with Uber in Miami Beach Fl. March 26 2016.,1.0,0

"This is my personal experience on 20th March, 2016 with Uber cab service. At 10.30 PM I was being threatened by a driver and I was trying to reach someone from UBER. Now see this, nowhere in the internet I could find any customer care number. I raised multiple complaints in 10-15 mins on UBER app. Until now (even after 20 hours) I did not get any response or call from them. Thus, there is not credibility or authenticity.Being a local Hyderabadi resident, I could deal with this abusive driver in my own way. But trust me, IT IS VERY UNSAFE TO USE UBER CAB SERVICE as you may not be able to question anyone if you get screwed. You don't have any authorization, I am not sure how government is allowing these services to run as even in the case of emergency, you do not have a local customer care number attached to it. I am in dilemma whether to raise police complaint against this driver who was calling my mobile continuously for an hour until midnight. Scared to imagine if I was a single non-local girl/lady in that situation. Pathetic.",1.0,0
"My experiences are mixed, with a couple of good rides, but on the whole were negative. Actual experiences: Bad - surge pricing has no upper limit. A trip which normally costs about $20 ended up costing almost $150 due to Uber's uncapped surge pricing policy. Uber has no city or government limit on prices, meaning that they can pretty much gouge what they want, as opposed to taxis who have rates limited by law. Often the surge pricing does not reflect the reality of what the demand and cost actually are out in the streets, extending beyond the actual ""surge"" in demand in order to add a little extra.Bad - A trip was in a vehicle which was so poorly maintained that all the warning lights on the dashboard were flashing, and the vehicle was noticeably shaking/swerving. The driver was struggling to keep the vehicle in the lane, narrowly avoiding collisions with other vehicles. I was literally in fear of my life. Bad - When pooling with another rider, a driver refused to take us the most economical (and fastest) route, driving about 12 miles out of the way (and past one of the destinations twice) telling us that the Uber management had told him to go by the GPS route and could not deviate from it in anyway, getting angry with us when we pointed out the cost benefits of decent route planning.Good - A friend was drunk had had to be shipped home, (in return for a good tip) the Uber driver called us to let us know she had been dropped off safely and that she had made it inside her apartment without issue. Good - Pickup times are ok, usually I can get an Uber within 15 to 20 minutes of ordering. Bad - Drivers accept trips and then cancel ten minutes later, leaving you stuck to order again. This seems to happen a lot at the cusp of ""surge"" pricing times, meaning the pre-surge price you originally ordered at is now increased.Bad - Even though drivers can cancel without reason or at the last minute at no cost to the driver, Uber charges passengers a cancellation fee. Bad - Even though city ordinances for ground transportation are clear, in that Uber could (if it wanted) operate entirely legally with only minor administration costs, a notarized application and a city bond, Uber has decided that obeying the law is not acceptable, and is fighting to get the law changed. Odd that small companies can follow the law, pay fees and bonds, and make a profit, but a multinational corporation can't seem to find the time or money to complete a little paperwork.Mixed - Some Uber drivers have excellent navigation skills and know the city well, knowing the back routes past traffic and obstructions, others seem to be unable to read a map, follow GPS or listen to route suggestions from long-term residents, some seem unable to even use their eyes and read road signs, whilst at least two drivers I have had have been able to get lost finding their way around a small parking lot.",2.0,0
"I used Uber from Sky Harbor airport. First a UberX got wrong address and called from nowhere after 10 minutes and asked me cancel trip since she went to wrong address and far away from me, Uber charged me 5 dollars for cancellation and unexpected. Second time Uber directed me to select UberSelect and got the driver. He was late, before I took his car I asked the price and he said he is Uber SELECT and it cost 60 USD to my home. I go to Sky Harbor very frequently and it is exactly 30 miles from my home. He took the longest route and charged 95 USD for 38 miles. Will never take UberSelect, or Black or SUV...

And since he got lost, I got charged $30!!! On paper, Uber sounds like a good idea, but in reality it doesn't work.

My sister and I had a quick ride from one bar to another on Saturday night in LA County. The driver dropped us off right by the bouncer who can confirm that neither of us was drunk and driver didn't have any interaction with us when we were leaving/expressed concerns. We had no liquid on us as well (if it is a spill). Later I found out that I was charged $200 cleaning fee. I reached out to Uber who sent me a picture of the wet seat. This mess does not belong to me however Uber still charged me a cleaning fee. They trust their driver but not their customers. I strongly believe that it is the way for Moustafa (my driver) retaliated against me because he believed that I would give him poor ratings since we had an unpleasant talk that night. Earlier that night he picked up wrong people and made me wait for over 20 minutes to come back pick me up. This driver is lying.,1.0,0
I use both Uber and Lyft occasionally and have found both services very convenient. However I think Lyft does a better job of screening their drivers. A recent ride with Robert on 2/16/16 started out fine then he aggressively began to proselytize and ask me if I would accept Jesus Christ as my personal savior. I was trapped for the ride and he was on the freeway speeding and weaving on the road. I began to pray that's for sure!

"A request for a UBER driver roughly on Feb 6th 2016 to pick me up at Wal-mart. According to the driver it would take her about 10 minutes to arrive at my location. When she didn't show, I called her for her ETA. She asked if I was in LA Mirada which was about 20 minutes away. I was in Stanton. Then she said that she had another pickup and had to cancel mine. On Feb 8 UBER took out $5.00 from my checking account saying it was for a no show... For a no show? How can it be a no show when the driver never showed. I called UBER and told them about it and they reimbursed the $5.00 but then on the same day took out the $5.00 again. I emailed them again asking for the refund. They asked for my card number and other info. Today is Feb 15 and NO REFUND. Why should I pay for something I never received. I told them to cancel my account and reimburse the $5.00. Now UBER is saying that they can't give me my money back because I closed my account. All of this problem began on Feb 8 (7 days before I asked them to close the account).

Next day I checked my phone, never got any type of email receipt (usually I get them immediately after I get dropped off) so I begin to think they didn't charge me. Several days go by, and still no receipt then comes Thursday, February 5th, I receive the receipt. Are you ready?? For $424.08!! At my shock, I immediately file a claim with UBER via email, since they don't even have a phone number. I explained to them my story and they said we need to hear the driver's story. They emailed me back and said, that I instructed the driver to drive 2 other passengers to 2 other drop off points 80 miles away. This is a blatant lie, as my 2 passengers got off with me at the drop off point. After I hear this absurd story, completely fabricated by the driver, who just wanted to run up the meter, I become outraged.

"I recently moved to Orlando and my car ended up the shop shortly after. I decided to try Uber to get back and forth to work. I really like the app and how you can see where the driver is so I know when to leave out my apartment and meet them. But prior to my order I added two credit cards to my Uber account. One is a bank debit card the other is a prepaid debit card, both with VISA logos. Uber defaulted to the bank card for payment. However, I wanted to use the prepaid debit card but for some reason it wouldn't switch. My bank card didn't have the funds for the trip but it allowed the pre-authorization.Well, after contacting customer service which you can only do via email, I learned that Uber doesn't accept prepaid debit cards as payments. WTH?! If taxis can, why not Uber? Lyft is the same way. Well PayPal also doesn't accept prepaid cards so I couldn't even pay that way. Since Uber and Lyft are apps that you can only pay by way of credit cards or bank debit cards, this gives taxis the edge in my opinion. Now I'll have no other option but to use cabs until I get my car out the shop. This sucks.",2.0,0

"Called Uber for a ride to a local movie theater. It's only 7 miles away, but took us 30+ minutes. After the 10 a.m. movie, I logged on to Uber to get a ride home and found that my ride was still in progress! The driver was still on the clock for a 3+ hour ride. He was dozens of miles north. I canceled immediately and got a bill for $54! Unbelievable. Uber has not yet resolved the issue, but I am bewildered that something like this could happen.",1.0,0
My experience is much better than many of the reviews. The drivers I have had are friendly and helpful. Several times there has been a problem with the software but fare adjustment was done right away. I sent emails to customer support about problems in the software that had the driver going around in circles trying to get the software to start -- Resulting in me being charged $9.00 too much. I emailed customer service and received an adjustment to my debit card within 2 hours. No car company can be on time all the time especially in traffic. I live outside the city and commute to high traffic areas. I find UBER to be MUCH more reliable than yellow cab.,5.0,1
"My daughter flagged down an Uber driver in Hollywood last night. He was driving a car with the Uber sign. He said he was off duty, but agreed to provide her a ride from Hollywood to Marina del Rey. Once there, she handed him $40. He said the price was $50. All she had was $40 in cash. He said, ""You're a pretty girl. There's a way to pay off your bill. Have sex with me."" At this point, my daughter jumped out of the car and ran. I asked her if she called 911. She said she was freaked out and had gotten away from him.We normally take Lyft in LA because of our numerous bad experiences with some male Uber drivers in Hollywood being verbally abusive, aggressive, crazy drivers, treating the customer horribly. I called the Marina Del Rey police department to file a report. They said the address it occurred at, was under the LAPD Pacific division. LAPD wouldn't do anything, but said report it to Uber. There is not a complaint line, and I cannot find a Customer Service line for Uber, as I see others have attempted to do as well. So I am posting it here.",1.0,0

I quickly cancelled and order carefully switching from the default to the regular Uber. Later I got charged for the cancelled Pool ride. I was charged for a defective new service and a defective app that fails to cancel their failed new services. Uber is a greedy company that makes too much money out of the commissions of drivers and all Uber does is to create that buggy app, they should test it, fix it and no blame and charge customers for their mistakes.

"I called Uber at O'Hare airport. The meter shows $61.00. When I arrived destination, Uber emailed me saying ""Your trip cost $128 which is highly unusual for this route. We'll review it before sending you the bill"". I emailed back telling them the actual meter price was $61. Guess what? When I got the finally bill, they put $104 as meter price and added 20% tip ($21) for the driver who doesn't even speak English. And also charged me $2 as ""booking fee"" thus to make the total bill as $128 as the driver initially reported. I was shocked that this is the company advertising not to take tips and now they added 20% tip by myself and billed me. No matter how many emails I sent to their customer support, nobody responded. Since they have my credit card and can charge freely, now I have to contest through my credit card company. It'll be fool for anybody trust this company and give them your credit card number to let them bill you in fraud!",1.0,0
"There are several things that annoy me about the Uber service in the Boston, MA area. (1) You cannot cancel an ordered drive when it becomes apparent that the driver of the car cannot seem to find where you are at despite phone calls and having past your drive area two to three times without having to pay for the cancellation because of the driver's outright ineptness. If I can track them as they pass by three times, so can The Uber network. It should be three times and you are out, period.(2) I was on a ride this evening where the driver could not find where we were even though we say their car go by twice. The GPS kept telling her where to turn and she kept missing the turns. And this was more than likely because the driver had the radio up loud playing hip-hop music and they were just plain not paying attention despite the fact that we had to tell the driver where to go. So much for the Quiet, Clean, and Courteous rides. (3) On an average from the same spot that I normally have to catch a cab, Uber, or Lyft from, it takes 15 to 30 minutes for the drivers to show up. My experience with Lyfts is that they are usually there before I get out of the door of the building and in worse conditions, never have to wait more that 5 minutes max. (4) Many Uber drivers are also or have been taxi drivers, so you get taken for a ride either way. My complaint is a general one because I am getting fed up with poor service from those that brag that theirs is better than any other. Clearly it is not. At least not in Boston.",1.0,0
"We took an Uber fare and received a notification 2 days later that there was a fare change adding $200 to the charged amount. This was done without asking any questions from us as the passengers. There were no incidents in this car! No vomiting, nobody had any drinks or food. There were 3 adults, no children. This Uber driver is either lying or confusing us with someone else. It is wrong that Uber just automatically charges the customer without asking if it is correct and the driver should have to report it immediately or have the passenger acknowledge the incident. DO NOT use Uber. They could randomly charge your card! There isn't a customer service person to speak to either. You have to try to dispute the charge by email.",1.0,0
"October 31st at 11:01 PM, we requested an Uber pickup in Fort Lauderdale, FL. Immediately we received a text that said since it was a busy time, there would be a surcharge and our fare would be 2x the normal amount. We agreed since it was Halloween and a busy time. 11:01 PM we received a text that Uber was arriving. Uber did not show up. We text Uber twice to let them know we were in front of a restaurant which is easy to find. 11:20 PM we called and spoke with the Uber driver who said he was in traffic and would be there in two minutes. 11:3 PM still no Uber driver. We hailed a taxi who did not charge us double and we cancelled the Uber trip. Uber emailed us to let us know that our credit card was charged $5 for cancellation. We went onto Uber account and let them know this was not acceptable. Uber customer service gave us a credit of $5 toward the next Uber trip, and would not refund the $5. Uber gives service that is only convenient for them. They surcharge during busy times and do not show up. If we accept businesses treating consumers like this, where will it end?? Are restaurants next to charge us double because we wish to dine at a busy time such as a Saturday night vs a slower Tuesday? This type of treatment is not acceptable. Think about it.",1.0,0

"I signed up with Uber about a week ago. My car is in the shop. I could not rent a car because I have a freeze on my credit report that I refuse to have lifted (that's another horror story). I set up my account with Uber and willingly gave them my billing information. I only wanted a ride to and from work. Well, the first ride worked fine. A tad expensive but I was not crying. The return ride was not set with the company because the account set up didn't allow for it (I booked on my home based iPad). The driver said he would pick me up from work and I could pay him. Although a tad expensive this too worked out ok. The next day the horror began. The driver said he would pick me up and we could bypass Uber. He didn't show although I called him twenty times. I then called Uber. They told me they would come but it would cost three times the fare (fee would be over $120 to go less than ten miles). I was desperate and agreed. They never showed. The taxi company said they could come an hour later. I was going to be late for work and I started crying. A friend saved the day but by then I couldn't stop crying. I have asked Uber for a phone number and they have not responded. What sort of company does this/that? Oh, the driver finally called to say he had been out partying and his phone died.",1.0,0
"I recently had to take my dog to get her an appointment to get her shot. Everything went well and, as always, when I arrived back home from the doctors I checked behind my seat to see if me or my dog left a mess behind. Which we DID NOT. The next day I go to my local pet store with my family to buy her treats and my card is declined. Turns out Uber charged my card $200!! I asked them why was that money taken out and they said the driver sent a report that my dog urinated and left feces in his car. I knew he was either lying or got the ride. So I simply told them they made a mistake and if they could please refund me back my money. The lady sent me a photo of ""evidence"" of the mess left behind and I almost laughed and forgot how angry I was. (I pasted a photo of the evidence they sent me). I told them that is not feces. And if my dog would have used the bathroom in the car : 1. It would have stained. 2. It would have smelled right away. 3. She cannot pee in a car while laying down!

"I'm visiting NYC and was attempting to get the attention of a taxi driver and a black Lincoln Continental pulls up with a sheet taped to the right window ""UBER"". The driver said he could take me the 1.5 miles to my destination. I told him I'm not signed up with UBER but heard the rates are better than a taxi. After getting to my destination, he told me the charge was $45 plus a tip and I said ""You've got to be kidding."" I asked him to show me how he came up with that and he said he does this everyday and knows the rates. He refused to provide a fare estimate and said the fare was based on what he normally charge. I told him I think his practice is illegal and he started to use profanity towards me while speaking very loud and threatened to call NYC when I asked for the fare estimate.I told my friends about the experience after meeting them and they said the driver isn't supposed to take cash for fares because they get paid through the company. Needless to say, I'm extremely upset and will never ever trust this UBER invention again. However, I do hope to see the car again and the middle eastern driver. In addition, I'm going to file a report with the Attorney General, BBB, and other regulatory agencies.",1.0,0
"This is a warning to anyone that uses Uber. On October 9, 2015 I used UberX to take me approximately 10 miles, downtown to the auto dealership on Howe Ave, to pick up my car from a scheduled service. My office is located on J street with ample parking in front. I put my pick up location in accurately, and saw on the Uber app that a car was 5 minutes away. I waited on the curb for the next 15 minutes, at which point I sent a text message to the driver. He never replied and cancelled the pickup shortly after. I was notified another driver would be at my location in 5 minutes.The driver showed up after another 10 minutes. His car was an older Nissan, several dings and scratches on the exterior and the interior was dirty. The seats had several deep stains and the car smelled of cigarette smoke. He asked me as to my destination, I told him it was entered in the app. He said he didn't have it. Once he was set, which took another 5 minutes we were off. He was driving excessively fast down J street, at times we were doing 50 mph. That is nearly twice the speed limit. I asked him to slow down, then we ran a red light. I told him that I wanted out, he said he would slow down. At the first stop light, I exited his vehicle. To my shock, the trip in his car showed up as a 47.15 expense. That was for going no more than 3 miles. I contacted the customer support at Uber, explained my experience and they said I accepted a ""surge"" rate and I had no recourse.I took down the driver's license plate number and called the CHP. The officer I spoke to said there was little they could do since they did not witness the violations. He did say that Uber drivers are not professionally trained, the cars can be unsafe and it is a ""rider beware"" scenario. As I understand it from reading up on Uber, I am not alone in these experiences. In addition, there are issues regarding the drivers insurance as well. I will never use Uber again, ever.",1.0,0

At least in my market (Twin Cities, MN) you are going to make about $10 to $13 an hour BEFORE EXPENSES. When you factor in gas, wear and tear on your car, tires, brakes, etc. you are likely making about $5 per hour!

I had lost power from my cell phone at that time! I tried to explain the situation but did not understand English at all. I requested him to drop me off at nearby safe place, he declined.

After driving a a mile he realized he had a wrong ride. So, he had no clue! I had to wait so late in the middle of a road, finally took a taxi. I am so upset that I have no words to describe my experience today. Why did Uber allowed non-English speaking drivers in USA? Why did he pick us up from a wrong location? Why did he not have any courtesy to drop us off to a decent place? I asked Uber customer service to help, they simply added 5$ refund on my account.. Uber Request id **.

"I had the most horrible experience this afternoon riding an Uber taxi to Bush Intercontinental Airport, Houston. First of all, the exterior of the car was very dirty. The interior was no better, filth and grime was visible in the dashboard area. The car reeked of cigarette. When I asked the Driver if he had been smoking, all he did was fiddle with the A/C vents. After a while, he rolled down the window on his side slightly, I guess to reduce the cigarette smell, but that didn't really help. External heat and fumes came into the car, worsening the situation. I could hardly breathe and I developed a headache. My clothes still smell of cigarette.The driver was distracted throughout the roughly 1 hour ride, he was constantly checking his phone. Furthermore, the driver was overspeeding, going at 60 - 70 mph, on roads that have speed limits of 55 - 60 mph. When I told him that I wasn't in a hurry, he insisted that he was driving within speed limits. This type of car and driver should not be on Uber fleet.",1.0,0

Uber states that I ""accepted"" this rate at the time of the trip. Both of these trips have starting time of 3am. Telling me I accepted a price 8 hours before my trip is completely insane. This pricing surge was not given to me at the time of my trip. How do you conceive that a trip at 3am was given a surge price and agreed upon 8 hours prior?
