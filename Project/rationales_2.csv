208,"charged a wait fee. raising his voice. arguing. His voice continued to increase so that we were uncomfortable and he insisted that we get out of his car. As we got out of the car he screamed out the car window, ""Stupid."" In addition to the being rude, kicking us out of the car at the wrong location, and confrontational, his car was very messy and did not smell clean. "
