"I like the convenience of Uber, and have been a loyal customer for a long time. HOWEVER, when TWO of their drivers cancel on me within minutes, and then the PRICE GOES UP for the next one... I'm not a happy camper. I used to refer all of my friends to this service, especially the ones using Lyft.... Not any longer. $#*! this service, their drivers that were disrespectful on the phone with me... My business and my friends' business will go elsewhere. Thanks Uber, for your killings, lack of customer service, entitlement and garbage program. Byyyyyeeeeeeeeeeee.",1,0
UBER treats their drivers with disrespect and essentially scams drivers into investing more time and money than the company pays. Much better driving companies out there,1,0
Iam really disappointed with uber charges!! For the last 2 months have been calling uber in different routes but unfortunately when I agree with charges uber declares for a journey in the end I get a higher charge of $3-$5 without any explanation!! Only todays trip where I had limited funds on the account my charges had no issue!!! This is cheating!!!,1,0
"In fact, lately I haven't used any other service because Uber is just so effective and affordable, especially when going out socially, because drinking and driving is not an option.",5,1
Uber is a big fraud.. They charged me with double money.. My money was cut from pytm also  and my driver also asked for the money.. For the same there was no positive response from the uber customer care ...dont try it... It is a big cheater..,1,0
"I was a pretty loyal Uber customer until my last trip.  I open the app and the only three options are 1) wheel chair accessible, 2) uber cab and 3) Spanish. 1) I 100% feel for all handicapped and accept that there are options for them. I think it's great. Should it be the first option? No. Should there be a setting on the app that says the car needs to be handicapped accessible? Yes. 2) Why on earth would I call a taxi when I'm particularly calling uber to AVOID taxis????? The cost of uber cab makes absolutely zero point in calling an uber. It's more expensive! 3) Why in the $#*! do we have a Spanish option when we are in an English speaking country? There wasn't an English option when I was in Croatia using Uber recently. Nor did I expect it. $#*! UBER I WILL NEVER USE IT AGAIN.",1,0
"Uber is frud , uber driver charged double amount from me on 20/10/2017. I was traveling from Thane to vikroli. I checked amount was Rs 176. After dropping me he charged Rs. 470. About this problem I discussed through sms but no positive response from customer care. They are not even return my money. Driver create show on the road so I paid money. But customer care people are also frud people. They don't want to resolve the Issue
My suggestion is don't go With uber. They don't even have contact number. They are cheaper and cheater",1,0
"I received e-mails from Uber asking me why I do not take Uber anymore. There is no way to reply to - they only SEND emails, they DO NOT ACCEPT e-mails.

1. AUTOMATED customer service is the biggest problem of Uber. That is the first reason for which I stopped taking Uber. I tried to call Uber when in need. I found with difficulty a number on the web. I called it and a stupid message said: ""Don't bother leaving a message, there are 20,000 messages in this mailbox"". Whoever left that message was a major $#*!, Probably Travis Kalanick or one of those $#*!y bastards that Uber has plenty of.

2. Uber VERY POOR customer service has cost me $ 650. In May 2016 I forgot my new iPhone ($650) in the Uber and there was NO WAY to retrieve it - there is NO Uber phone customer service where one can talk to a live person and explain the problem.

That's a big flaw. I called Uber automated customer service from a hotel and never received an answer. I e-mailed multiple times, I left feedback over the Uber website. I received a response only TWO DAYS afterwards. Of course, TWO DAYS afterwards my iPhone was long gone. That is why Uber poor customer service has cost me $ 650. Uber has not offered me any compensation for that - and THE SAME THING can happen again. 

3. The cars are often dirty. I initially switched from taxis to Uber because I cannot stand taxis that are dirty and smell of food because the driver eats in there. However over time the Uber has started being just as bad. There is no quality control of car. I have had dirty Uber cars, or banged up Uber cars or drivers that couldn't follow a GPS and took much longer than they should have. The dirtiness is by far the biggest problems.
In contrast, Lyft has CLEAN cars. It enforces cleanliness.

4. I do not care about the negative press that Uber has had. However, I do care very much about:
- the car being CLEAN, with NO FOOD SMELL
- the driver that knows how to drive and follow a GPS.
- your having an ACTUAL customer service. It is impossible to e-mail Uer - though uber DOES send email to you. 

Until Uber solves these problems, I will no longer take Uber cars. I will go to Lyft and other competitors, every time.",1,0
This guy is the worst Uber driver I have ever met he doesn't even show up when asked to be picked up do not let him drive you anywhere,1,0
"If you are in the Philadelphia area and your uber driver is Daemon, cancel it real quick. When she picked me up she was at the wrong address so I had to literally walk a 1/2 block to her car and when she called me to ask where I was at, she was rude, even though she was at the wrong house!

Her car smelled very bad (musty and dirty clothes) and it was dirty! She had water bottles on the floor and crumbs on her seats. I couldn't even dust them off because of the kind of seats she had. So I sat in crumbs the entire ride to work.

When it was time to drop me off, she was at the wrong location once again and I had to get out and walk a block to my building. She is by far the worst uber driver and I have had some bad drivers but she is flat out terrible.",1,0
"I was late for my work and appointment because driver's cancelled it for no reason, my place is easy to find so I wondered why they kept cancelling my trip. I had cancelled many times...it's not funny anymore "" Uber"" . I am almost done with you ""uber"". This company Sucks! I've been nice to all your drivers even if sometimes some of the uber driver's stinks I was still polite towards him. Now I download Lyft and will try it. Thank-you Uber!!!",1,0
I've drove Uber for several months last year. I haven't drove for them since I found a good paying job but as of now could use the extra money for holidays. I've been trying to log back into my active account but had no luck retrieving a varification code since I no longer have the same phone/number. I've tried numerous times to contact them about this but with no luck. Every message I send are returned saying I cant reply to that email. & when I go to the website for Uber help I stil get no results back.,1,0
"Uber accepted a prebooking for a 5 a.m. pick up to the airport with a quote of $32 base price plus taxes. An e mail stating that surge pricing was in effect was sent just as the driver arrived. We were already in the street. There was no time to cancel and book a limo so we got in. As a result, our fare was augmented to $126. I complained and they reduced it to $114. I am still fighting for a fair settlement . Today I took a cab.",1,0
"Worst experience of contacting Uber customer care. I left a sunglass and called within minutes of dropping, however they failed to connect the driver immediately and later sends an email saying they didnot find anything. This is ridiculous and highly unethical.",1,0
I do not recommend this business to anyone. This company is fraudulent and withdrew without my permission 455.39 from my checking account. If you have kids and bills don't use the uber app or service. I use my card online often and this has never happened to me before I rate this company a big fat zero.,1,0
"I have been a loyal user of Uber and it has always been my go-to means of getting from point A-B. But today, I've officially withdrawn and deleted their app. Heres why:
Two nights ago, I've ordered a cab for my girlfriend to get home after a huge argument around the time of 3 a.m. Keep in mind her phone died at the time. Her destination was from Manhattan to Brooklyn. The next day, she had told me she was dissatisfied with a pool customer who gave her an attitude and told my girlfriend to ""shut up"" after talking to the driver named Raja. She was tremendously upset to begin with and it caused her to get off the car a few blocks later, which took her to the 1 train. We are super easy going people and we have discovered the driver Raja, has NEVER ended the trip at the time she was dropped off- which was only 5 blocks later and had fully taken advantaged of the circumstances and drove an empty passenge car to her destination in Brooklyn. I did not fully realize this until it was too late - so I had rated him 5 stars before I got the chance to report him. Again we were in an argument so we didn't not talk until a day later.
First of all she and I were not drunk at all. And I have reached out to uber and they have refused to refund me for the amount of $27. Although the money is not the issue but the dishonest driver. I will be going to Lyft from now on. I do not regret my decision.
Also I notified uber and told them the details and these illiterate workers reviewing my complaint do not even respond to the problem but are confusing that I want a refund because the fare amount itself is wrong. I regret to say that Uber hires lousy drivers that take advantage of customers at 3am. and if they had looked into my transaction profile, I already spend quite a lot for cabs, theres no reason for me to go beyond for 27$ unless it was the truth",1,0
"I have had several instances recently where I go to order and Uber tells me it's 2-3 minutes and then I confirm the order and it's 8-10 minutes (tech glitches).  I have also had drivers who can't speak English and I must tell them where to go despite them having their map app on their phone available to them.  Incompetent drivers and failing technology are not ingredients for a good user experience.  When notified of their failings, Uber curtly replies that they work hard to provide the best user experience.  Really, that's your best?",1,0
"My husband signed up for Uber online and schedule a pick up time to get the car,which was at 5:00pm at the office (location 04644)1398bryantstreet94102. we arrived 30 minutes before the scheduled time.

People have been here since 11am and were exhausted. So we thought being as they closed at 5:00pm,we probably wouldnt have to be here as long. 

It's now after 6pm  and I had the time to write this review. Not only are we waiting for the longest, but every time we asked questions regarding the cars,no one seems to know what's going on. One of the workers said he's already off the clock and that he couldn't help. We further asked to speak with the manager and she was more unprofessional!!! She literally got pissed at one of the customers then claim ""she's doing us a favor"". I couldn't help but to let her know how unprofessional and very out of order she is...but she continued and even got mad at me also and shouting in her native language. 

DON'T COME HERE!!!",1,0
"I used Uber 6 times and twice They cancelled my order and charged me a $5 cancellation fee both times but it was Uber who cancelled, not me. There is no customer service so they just pocket the money. $10 is all they will ever steal from me.",1,0
"I will and always have admitted, it's not about loyalty but business. I supported uber in the past because they were getting the job done better than the cab companies. And in a sense they are still more efficient than the dying breed of the cab industry. However there are and will continue to be more rideshare business. Look what Napster did to the music industry and look where Napster is now? 

Uber has gone down hill for me as this whole rating thing has gotten out of hand. I am on time for my driver, respectful (treating them the way I want to be treated), and despite not liking the tipping I still do it. I don't like the rating as it's pointless. If I give the driver a bad rating legitimately they will and have rated me poorly. Anything less than a 5/5 for a driver is ""wrong"". So the passenger gets bullied into giving them a perfect score. Then there is this tipping which I have been in the service industry and support it but UBER was all about the no tipping and now if you don't tip enough or worse on time, the driver rates you poorly. Personally, I don't care if a drive likes me or not but when my rating can impact me getting a ride, this is where the problem is.

Some examples I dealt with is I had a driver in Montreal who didn't speak English and I did the best I could to communicate in French and so my rating goes down. In Phoenix, my driver was soliciting his private driver business and when I couldn't use his same thing. And most recently in Seattle one driver was so depressing talking about how she has no friends and that she doesn't know Seattle well. I had to end up using my own gps using international Data and yet now I get a bad review. I was scared to give this lady a 4/5 yet alone worse. And I have gained other example.

I have supported UBER coming to Calgary and Edmonton, even when they were booted out temporarily. Now that I live near Vancouver, I was supporting them coming there as well. Now, I'm starting to change my mind.

My point is now I'm considering going with other options including the awkward hailing of a cab! Regardless, ride sharing will continue to grow, the question is, will UBER be a part of this or eventually not exist like Napster, being just another company that started a trend?

FYI they make it hard for you to contact them with complaints unless you say you were in an accident.",1,0
"My son booked me an Uber to take me to the station to catch a train to the airport. When I got in the driver started going at about one mile an hour and drove up loads of little side roads, going round in circles in completely the wrong direction and wasting a good 15 minutes. When I told him I had a train and flight to catch he suddenly said he was looking for other customers because it was a shared ride. I rang my son who said it definitely wasn't shared and to tell the driver to get a move on. He refused to. I asked could he then change it to unshared and charge the extra and he said no. I asked him to call his superior and he said there was nobody there to call. I explained that if I missed the one train an hour I'd miss my flight and there wasn't another one for seven days. Effectively I'd lose my whole holiday. He shrugged and carried on at one mile an hour. There was nothing I could do and even if I'd got out of his car he'd taken me down such quiet roads there was no chance of finding another cab. This was 3am in the morning and eventually after much screaming on my part he gave up looking for sharers - but I made it to the station with two minutes to spare and had to to try and run up numerous platform steps with two pieces of heavy luggage. I will never forget the experience and will never ever use them again.",1,0
Warning uber is a scam and there is no customer service and there drivers are drunks and drug addicts and sexual harassment,1,0
First of all you can't talk to anyone at Uber because they do not have phone support. After I finally found the online support team I asked why I was getting charged a monthly fee. I never opened an account with them. They did not know and continued to charge me even after I told them to stop. Instead my monthly bill got higher. They asked me to prove they were billing me by sending them screen snapshots and the last four of my credit card. Can you believe that? I had to prove to them that this was happening. So I did and then they asked me to give them the first 6 numbers on my credit card. Which I did. This company is either very incompetent or corrupt. I will never use their service!,1,0
"My granddaughter and I ordered an uber from santa monica beach pier . Three drivers cancelled and I was charged for the third one with them stating that the driver waited over 2 minutes for me. I was at the pickup point long before I ever contacted this driver. He evidently left  and charged me with a cancellation fee and I followed the rules. Uber has shown to a very shadowy company from the get go. From now on, I will be a customer of Lyft! I have disputed this with the BBB, no response from uber so now I am making you aware.",1,0
"Terrible experience with Uber service today. The rider Roger, Chrysler 300, 7LHV109 accepted my ride request but never showed up and ignored my calls and text messages. My App showed he was sitting near a shopping plaza a mile away instead of picking me up. After 35 minutes in the heat, my cell phone died and I had to take a taxi. Terrible service! And Uber charged me money for its driver's failure!",1,0
"I was picked up from my workplace on 30/8/2017 at around 8:56 pm by cab no. TN 07 CE 8554. The trip started on my account but the drivers account was not updated. navigation kept directing the driver to my pick up point. finally after taking a full circle and wasting my time he called up customer service. the executive directed him to cancel my ongoing trip and ask me to book another assuring that the same cab will be assigned. the driver cancelled and when i booked again i was assigned a ride 20 min away. the driver asked me to get off on the street amidst a downpour. when i refused to get off away from my pick up point, while it was raining and demanded to talk to customer service again, the driver called up the office again but refused to let me speak. customer service executive told him to tell me that i am not being charged for the trip so get off. I have never seen such behavior in my life. the moment you undertake the responsibility of a trip, you are taking responsibility for our time, safety and good service delivery and in return take payment from us. you cannot waste our time, compromise our safety and then put us through discomfort and finally say 'ok we won't charge you this time'. looks like uber is no better than a bunch of scoundrels with no work ethics or standards.",1,0
"Worst customer service I've ever encountered.  Every response is just a copy/paste canned response...they don't even read the actual complain/comment/request.  I have to send my issue to them 7-10 times with multiple responses back...that's about 30-40 emails back and forth to get something as simple as a $5 cancelation ride waived because the app froze and I couldn't cancel in time.  It's just ridiculous.  Glad all the Sr. leaders of the company resigned or were fired.  Hopefully it changes the culture, but I doubt it, all the customer service reps are nasty ass offshore peeps that don't care about anything but their ""ticket resolution"" numbers.",1,0
"I just wanted to write and let all of you at Uber that I had the most amazing driver the other day! As soon as I got in the car, he handed me a bowl of delicious treats, I thought that was so sweet! Then he handed me a bottle of water.  This may not be a big deal to some, however, it actually made my day! He was so polite, helpful, generous and all around awesome!!! Please please let this driver, Jasur Nazarou # 5756433 know that he is awesome!! He deserves some sort of praise from all of you at Uber! All of your drivers should take notes from this guy! All of your drivers need to be like him!!! WONDEEFUL EXPERIENCE!!!!

"I recently started driving for UBER and you know what everything has been exactly as it was supposed to be. Will there be a hiccup at some point? Probably. But all of you who are saying you got ripped off so many times, first of all I don't believe it has happened as often and as badly as you all claim but if it has happened to you more than 2 times then maybe instead of bit@#$ing about it you should just stop using it. I drive because I need the extra money and most of the problems you may or may not have are caused by the app or the company not the drivers. I am very professional and have not had one issue with a rider or the app as of yet and I depend on the money to support my family so I take it very seriously. Please at the very least don't give drivers bad ratings because your fare was too high or the wait was too long. we get there as fast as we can at least the good drivers. Bad reviews for the drivers when it is the app or the companies rates fault can cause us to be deactivated. I like the extra money I earn and depend on it to do fun things with my family.

"The worst company I have ever been involved with.......I had driven for them for over 6 months.....Had great reviews from my customers.....I even eventually took part in their Xchange leasing program...so they were getting a double bump from me...well after learning that I really could not make enough money paying all my bills with them I had to divest some of my time to get another job....well I ended up going out of the country for 3 weeks on a potential employment trip....so fell behind on some leasing payments...I immedieately tried to communicate my situation with them and see if I could work out something...well because you cannot talke to anyone on the phone until last week...you can see how difficutl it would be to communicate my situation....after finally getting someone to talk to on the phone...they basically told me they could not do anything I needed to talk to Xchange leasing...after months of talking to a ""warranty company' which I found out was Xchange leasing in disguise...ran by a bunch of people who are not capable of having discussions about leasing issues...and continually pushing the discussion to a warranty discussion....that lead to why cant these people tell me they are Xchange leasing?...something really weird here....So long story short about 1 week of having my first discussion with an actual discussion human at UBER they come and take my car and to this day I have not had one open honest talk with Xchange leasing.......What an insult!!! Never invest your time in this company because they could care a less about the drivers, the REAL people out there bringing in the money...Oh but you will get a lot of fake pretend recordings on their call phone while you wait for hours before talking with them........I have never felt so insulted....after giving of my time to this excuse of a company...I just get mad thinking about it....and they will keep pretending they care I am sure.....................Bad Company",1,0
"For all there data, which is impressive, they have no idea or are just plain heartless, that taxis drive  19.1 mph. Which translates to $13.62 per hour. The same # all the other drivers mention.  I am giving it up and I work mostly in the Hamptons, NY, where they raise the rate 60-70% to $22.31 per hour.  People have no problem paying more ant the Hamptons rate should be the BASE rate. Basically this app sucks. I agree with a previous review that said you make pennies. Consider this, you drive 12 min to pickup, do a 5 min fare, and collect $3.67.  BTW, you have no idea where you are going. So now you are 5 min further out of your way. Stay on the N. Fork (LI) and do garbage fares for $13/hr or drive to the S. Fork with nothing? Nobody tips, 8% of people.  Sure it's in the app, but I could not find it for my fare in their phone. Sure you work the ""Surge"" 1.8X, wow, now you make $20 and hour and get a red light ticket/pulled over because you don't know where you are.  Not to mention, you never work a surge for an hour because it disappears as  you approach, they know you are coming.  Therefore to make money, you turn off the app....no you don't make money or work that hour for a surge.  BTW there are 1000 ubers around you at all times, watching the ants on the consumer app drives you nuts. Lyft shows you were they are at any location: another form of torture as it confirms your good spot is taken up by 23 Lyfts (which is about 60% of the Uber fleet). 3 Long hauls to NYC for a ""Bro price"" which not only includes gas, but lunch too: 2:35 hours to make $82, or 1:05 to make $80 when picked up in the Hamptons. I complained about the 82 fare, Uber said it was Kosher: sure I dropped at LaGuardia AND MIDTOWN in rush hour, no worries. Sat night I earned $296 in the Hamptons, minus gas in 10 hours.  I KNOW THE HAMPTONS and have driven taxis since '99 part time.  This is what a good driver gets for driving 300 miles. Every night I drive is 250-300 miles. 1000's of miles add up.  Uber will get you out of a financial jam, and I will use it on MONGO nights: Concerts/Labor day, but it sucks and they have no problem having it suck for the driver, evidenced by the fares.  That's all I got...oh yeah, premium/select drivers do 10% premium fares (30% of their profit), but do 90% of the base x fare.  So they make....$18 per hour to pay for their Mercedes:) or grind it into dust. XL Fares are few and far in between, unlike gas stations for my Yukon.  My car was a Charger 25 mpg+.  NO Money in it. As the last fare said, give this up...and wait tables. I did get $210 for the puker in my car from S.Hampton, same care I put my kids in.......delete the app is what I should do.",1,0

By far Uber treats there drivers as if they are convicts on bad review or someone does not like you you will be dismissed.  If an incident happens and you try to get information they automatically assume you are guilty.  I was recently sexually harrased by one of my customers while driving I noticed Uber of the situation and they brushed if off basically saying it was my fault and I should have not interacted with the customer.  The immediately deactivated my account without giving me any notification and then stated I was under investigation I called the company and all I got was the run around someone will get back to me.  Then an email stating that my account would be permanently deactivated I was the victim but they want to keep these so called good ratings.  They do not care about there drivers at all beware stay away,1,0
"I had good experience with almost 50% of the drivers but some can be very dishonest. I Had to use Uber a lot during the month of May/June 2017 due to and accident that prevented me from driving.
Case #1: The driver charged me 100% more of the initial fare. He reported we were more than 4 riders. Not true. We were just my husband and I. After many claims from my part Uber eventually refunded me.
Case #2: The driver reported that we changed the destination address. Not true. He charged 100% more of the initial fare. Uber never refunded me.
Case #3: The driver charged me 100% more of the initial fare. She reported that I didn't provide the correct destination address. I explained to her that it must have been a system glitch. I was late for the appointment with my doctor because of that. She reported me to Uber as if I made racial discrimination remarks. NOT TRUE. I contacted Uber and demanded a meeting with the driver to clarify that offensive report. Uber never was able to sustain the driver's claim and eventually they opted to ignore my messages. Very disappointing experience.
I might use Uber in the future but I'll be very cautious checking the charges before I leave the car after the service. And I would advice to customers to do the same.",3,1
Uber charged me 3 times for a trip I took three weeks ago. Then once I wrote into help which was no help they charged me 6 more times and never replied or re-funded me my money.

"My first time experience with Uber was objectionable!  Signed up as a first time rider with Uber under a promotion called Chase50.  Offer was for 50% off for first timers for the first 2 trips thru July 31, 2017.  Had a difficult time to get the first one honored and the second one was lamely refused.  Their app is terrible!  It willl not allow a promotion code to be accepted.  Communication thru the app is rigid and tortuous and the usual 800 number in the charges description won't allow any  incoming calls only refers you back to their app which is worthless. And to top it all the second driver's conduct and dress code was second rate to put it mildly.  Thank goodness for Lyft which I have been using all along without any problems whatsoever.  Their driver's professionalism is top rate.   Even their promotions are automatic.  I will erase Uber app not to use them ever again.",1,0

That's ridiculous. I have been doing lot of Uber rides but now onwards I want to tell everyone to keep a check on uber drivers in India.
This is very bad experience from uber. I thought Uber drivers were honest - didn't expect this at all.",1,0
"First and foremost, in India there is no customer care service from UBER. There is just a help tab through which we can raise a complaint and that will be solved after 24hrs (taking their sweet time to respond).

If a customer is in a deep trouble there is nobody to help. That pathetic ""HELP"" doesn't help actually.

There were multiple issues I have faced with UBER. But, today it was disgusting. I got ill because of the $#*!ty freshener used in the cab. Apart from that driver had stopped the car in the middle, ended the trip and told me to get down at the unknown place because I was ill. And I was helpless because UBER has only ""HELP"" tab which doesn't work at all at the time of need. He denied to take me to the destination as he had some other work. when I insisted him he told I'll take you to the X place (where he had some work) and then I'll drop you to the destination. He forced me get down. I had to taxi from that place to my destination (Thanks to God I found a taxi over there), by the way I was charged for this trip which was equivalent to trip charge. Who is going to help in this.

This is not the end yet. As the driver had ended the trip I was wrongly charged (more than what it is at time of booking) whose fault it was?? Driver was rude & abusive - UBER has ""HELP"" tab for your security.

I have raised many requests on UBER ""HELP"" till now no help.

One more important thing ""TIME"", nobody cares. Because of abrupt ending of the trip I reached my destination very late. Who is responsible??

This is not the first time I was wrongly charged, it has become usual.

"UBER has absolute terrible customer service. Someone hacked my account but fortunately can't charge my credit card. Afterwards, I can't activate my account. After numerous emails with help.uber with numerous useless advices like resetting password numerous time... it is still a NO. After 10 days, my account still does not work and the only way to contact them is via the help.uber service site. The response turn around time is 24 hours.

This is my first disappoint with Uber.",4,1
"I just spent 45 minutes of my life trying to simply update password and my 'Home' information on the Uber phone App. What an absolute joke.

called for uber to take us to union station from American university section of DC. initial proposed charge was  for $21 then just before pick up got message surge pricing in effect. without proposed charge. agreed since too late to reschedule with other company. pick up was at 9:47 am and there was little traffic. Charge  was $55.82. Fee for larger vehicle to accommodate handicap from Regan airport on return was $34 without tip. A longer trip. Contacted uber which was difficult and no remorse whatsoever. Will never use uber again as no trtust factor at all. Car was mediocre at best. not a accompany to be trusted under any circumstances.,1,0

"I booked uber but those drivers told that we are very far we won't come to pick you.up...they suggested me to cancel it and book it again...again the next driver told me the same... I will be simply charged due to cancellation...

"I had just arrived from the airport for my trip and was super excited to begin my vacation. However, my friend and I called for an Uber...which I highly regret now...that totally switched my happy mood into pure frustration and put me into the worst mood possible...

My friend had took my phone to call for an Uber. The Uber driver was very poor at communicating his destination. After waiting around for a bit, we told him we were at the gate that he told us to be waiting for him after running there in a hurry. He was very short and rude in the manner in which he communicated. Once I told him we were in arrivals, he told us that he said to be departures and cancelled the ride, and Uber had to audacity to charge me for NO service! 

In the normal world, when people arrive at a destination from a flight, they get picked up in ""arrivals"". I tried to contact Uber, but apparently they do not have a real phone line to call customer support. Trying to get my money back was such a pain and ruined the whole start of my trip. All I wanted was my money back, and I probably would have been fine and a little irritated about the experience but probably would of still continued to use Uber if they had simply refunded me....However, they would only give me ""Uber credit"" to use on my next trip and still charged my card. I told them to remove the charge from my card, but they said that was ""against their policy"". 

I have talked with a few others that have similar situations happen to them, and they were able to get full refunds for their charged cancellation...but I don't know why refunding my card in particular was against their policy. Seems as if the company picks and chooses who they want to refund...which wouldn't qualify as a ""policy"". 

I guess they would prefer to lose a customer to a competitor than refund a simple $5 cancellation. That simple $5 costs them close to $200 in lost revenue just for that weekend with all of us using Lyft and other transportation services instead. My first Lyft ride was really great, the driver had even given us complimentary waters and protein bars and his car seats were actually cool massage chairs!

Back to the point, Uber is not a good company...there are sooo many things that are wrong with them aside from stealing money from customers. They prefer employees that are greedy and will do anything at all costs to get ahead. I'm not just referring to the drivers (some have which have been nice to me on other occasions), I'm referring to the corporate dogs that devalue everyone around them.

"Uber/Lyft drivers need to know all the facts about doing this work. Hardly anyone is making money. Uber is preying onThe little money Uber/Left pay per ride doesn't compensate for all the related expenses. Almost no Uber driver knows that the official cost of driving a mile is $0.54. When you do the math by calculating all the related expenses for all the miles they drive, drivers are often losing money. Just borrowing from their car. Many still tell you they make money because they are very uninformed and are losing money while doing a very dangerous unhealthy work. Any job is better than this. It would be interesting to bring an accountant into the conversation.Please everybody do the math! The little money drivers are making after driving for hours, often through dangerous areas late at night,  goes towards the car's maintenance and depretation. The official cost of driving a mile is $0.54. If you drive 10 miles for Ubet you get about $6 and the cost for you is $5.40. You are not even making minimum wage. Drivers are destroying their cars, and getting very little in return, so that riders can have cheap convenient rides and Ubet can make money.",1,0
"The driver took ages to approach the location, didn't show up, cancelled my trip.. and then Uber charged me a cancellation fee.

And trying to get it straightened out, so called customer service kept sending me a form letters  that had nothing to do with my complaint. In my opinion Uber is a scam. Yes you can get where you're going but they charge you at least 20% more then they state their charging.  One time, they charge me three times what they stated they would be charging. It took in excess of 75 emails from me to get that straightened out. Don't waste your money, don't waste your time. Uber stinks",1,0
"I use Uber in China, Australia, India and UK and have found them to be reasonable up until now. I took an Uber in Brisbane recently and the driver was terrible. My female companion complained to the driver about his erratic unsafe driving in general, his ignoring of the navigator, ignoring of directions. Uber driver, knowing he would get a one star rating, then complained about us both making 'racist' remarks. I have no idea of what nationality the driver was, it was not even on my radar. My companion sits on University Boards and other Government agencies and is listed in top women business leaders, I also am on similar boards, travel extensively through Asia, Europe and India, we both have no racist comments to make, but we are immediately, according to Uber, guilty. Uber suspends account without discussion with me and then after only sending condescending patronizing emails 'about their community' as they are now also the new warrior and standard setter of community political correctness and protector of multiculturalism, supposedly 'unblocks' my account but it will not work. Despite trying several times to contact them to resolve,  emails are answered, one of our team will be in touch, still waiting. Uber's arrogance knows no bounds, they answer to no one but themselves, they are not only condescending in their attitude, they make public claims which they do not back up.   As they have to answer to know one except their own falsely manufactured 'community' which standards are set by a mutli-national based on profits, not moral or a code of conduct that has checks and balances denying a process for right of reasonable reply nor natural justice to their passengers. Their complaint service is purposefully designed to avoid human contact so they can make their morally one sided incoherent biased judgement in complete isolation and then make unfounded derogatory unable to be replied to judgments that if I knew who it was I would complain to the HRC. As they have no responsibility to local authority nor reasonable codes of contact and conduct, do not expect a fair go from Uber and do your best to out them as a self serving corporate usurer of community standards for their own profit motive while making false claims against real people of high standing in real communities, expose them for the hypocrites they are.

"Recently use UBER to and from NY La Guardia Airport from my home in Riverdale, NY.  The fare was $17.00 higher on the return trip than going to the airport.  When I complained to UBEr, I was told that 'surge pricing"" applied to my return trip.  Surge pricing is in effect during periods of high demand, high or heavy traffic,or bad weather.  None of these conditions applied.  In fact, we asked the driver upon pick up if it was particularly busy, and he confirmed clearly, it was not;  in fact he said it was extremely LIGHT.  There was absolutely no traffic on the trip from the airport to my home.   Conversely, on the trip TO the airport three days earlier, when my fare was $17.00 LOWER, the driver said traffic was extremely heavy and she took an alternate route to save time.  
I firmly belive UBER also uses their ""SURGE PRICING"" as a means to increase revenue during normally quiet times, forcing customers to pay higher fares in order to make up for fewer rides requested.  I find this very disturbing and unethical.  Finally, in UBER's response to my complaint, I was told that the fare was displayed before I accepted the ride.  And while this is true, I needed a ride home and price gouging is improper and unethical in any situation.  I am looking into other ride APPS, and will avoid UBER in the future.",2,0
"DO not drive for uber eats as this company has no value for any of it so called Partners. YOu will end up paying uber to drive for them and no profits. in addition you will be stress out because they also want to rate you for a rating system that you have no control over. I started driving for uber because i was recently laid off and needed some income. Like many before me i, fell prey to their deceiving craiglist advertising that  tell you that you could make up to 30 dollars and hour and that it was a fun no boss way to make money. DIN""T even come close to making minimum wage and in addition at the end of the year when i file taxes was told that i owed 1500. dollars. for taxes. SO after taxes, oil change, Gasoline, tires, and i ended up with nothing. I also tried their UBer eats was far more worse. I was waiting for over two hours to get a precious beep and after getting beep went up four set of stairs and customers don't even give you any tip. delivery fee was only 2.30 cents so after two hours. THis is what i made. In addition i did twenty hours for uber eats and made after gasoline 100. dollars far less than the minimum wage. DO NOT GET Deceived by their false adds to be your own boss and make as much.

Most of my Uber experiences have been good except....driver cancels and then there is a price surge.  Yesterday I was quoted 23 dollars and then the driver took his own crazy route and the bill is 38 dollars.  I also got ripped off when a driver went the wrong way.  Is this normal?,3,1

"I'll start by stating in New York uber has the most laziest drivers, more lazy and un- compromising than average crappy cab service. In my experience drivers refuse to contact their customers, they lack any ounce of hospitably, Ive seen cabs on my map literally pass right by me, are too lazy to find me or even make a U-turn. Despite the address I input some drivers will get lazy and drop me off at the wrong spot or a block away from my stop. Some drivers are either to old, lazy or stupid to know how GPS works, which cause locations errors most driver do not want to make up for, for a lot of errors drivers make I ""the customer"" have to compensate for. Uber's refund system is a joke! If a driver cancel a trip the cancel fee comes out of my pocket! And when I report it they give me credit (not an issue) but I want my real money they toke back! Their rating system is adorably useless, because regardless how many one stars a driver gets whats the point if you can't report the driver on their $#*!ty service or better, make a complaint, I've seen drivers that treat me like crap with five or four stars!?. I'm from NY and a lot of drivers are not American therefore theres a big broken English barrier, try explaining a location to someone who doesn't understand you or vice versa. The only reason I ever use uber is literally because Lyft has error issues on my phone, Lyft is also cheaper with nicer drivers, while uber is the Kwik-E-Mart of cab services. Ubers only good for drunk or lazy riders who don't understand good customer service.Tip for consumers: I’d recommend lyft or car renting (if you drive)",2,0

"I spent over an hour of my personal time seeking the lowest fare to the airport following meetings in Grand Rapids, MI. I'm a government employee, and every dollar counts. Out of over 30 options reviewed, UBER was by far the cheapest at $16 from downtown. Next best was $20, and then the others hovered around $35-45. Google revealed the secret technique on how to preorder a 5:15am Uber the night before.

Out of the shower I spy a circa 5:15am. text that, due to SURGE PRICING, my 5:25am fare would now be 3.5x what we had agreed to the previous evening, and I had 5 minutes (already spent in the shower) I could cancel without being charged a fee. The soonest cab ($40 fare) was 20 minutes away that I couldn't spare at this point. My $16 deal now cost $51. Cancelling Uber at this point would mean a missed flight, lost connections and expensive misery. There was nothing to do but pay whatever they asked. Sort of like breaking down in the middle of nowhere with the only mechanic being the crooked Sheriff's brother. Well played Uber! Well played! I can't help but think this is a frequently used well-planned scenario or else they would have made me aware of this surge thing the night before being a possibility.  Had they done so, I would have used a stable priced cab service. I shall never use Uber again. They not only screwed me, but all the transportation providers that were cheaper than $50. I also am left with a bitter taste of my Grand Rapids experience although everything else during my visit was superb. I will never recommend Uber to a friend or worst enemy.

Uber gives men a chance to cheat on there girlfriends or wife's. I've had it happen to me and know other women it's happened to.

"Driving for Uber is simultaneously good and bad. Pay is constantly fluctuating. Very unstable. $600 one week, $350 another week working same hours. They let anyone be a driver so there are more drivers now then there are rides available. Very incompetent system no way of contacting support except email or from app by selecting specific problem and even then they respond with an automated message based on problem. They do not help with maintenance or gas. A few cents off their gas credit card. Big whoop still spending $80-$100 a week on gas to drive full time and 6,000+ miles a month. And the service is way too cheap a measly 65 cents a mile and 11 cents a minute in my area with customer always wanting to make extra stops and screwing me out of my time. And they encourage people not to tip. Even for Uber eats I wait in long line and bring food to your door for $4 and no tip? Waste of time and destroys your car. Only good to make extra spending money not full time. Not to mention some customers are petty and will leave bad ratings for something like dirt on the floor. Ok 10 other people were in my car today how would I not have dirt, part of which is from you? I have time to vacuum after every ride? They expect so much out of a taxi service.

"After reading reviews by other disgruntled customers, I can see that my experience is unfortunately normal. 

I arrived at Manchester, UK airport around 10:30 pm and used the app to contact a driver. The app showed the driver was 3-5 minutes away but I waited 20 minutes before receiving a message that the ride was cancelled. Part of the problem was the waiting area was not clearly indicated and local police were not allowing cars to park so it wasn't easy to be met. However, I didn't receive a call and when I tried calling I didn't get an answer. 

I didn't give up and tried twice more since by midnight there were fewer cars but it didn't help. On one of the ride requests I cancelled within 5 minutes. Now back at home I see that Uber charged me $5 US for each cancelled ride, even the one I legitimately cancelled.

"Driver never showed and had the audacity to charge me for the full ride. I paid for it, was left with no ride and super late for my event. I finally called a cab - yes a CAB which showed up, more than I can say for MARIO, Jersey City driver from hell. If you see Mario as your ride, cancel it asap. He charged me 100%, for a ride I never took. Never saw him, ever. Uber refused to credit my account,after 4 requests.. So here is how they do business: Charge you whatever they want, and never even have to pick you up or be accountable for leaving you stranded. I WILL NEVER USE UBER AGAIN! By the way, how about common courtesy for a customer who was been a loyal passenger for years, this is how they treat people. BE warned, until you face it, you won't believe it.

They charge a non existing trip when all my family members were at home over the weekend. when nobody went anywhere, they came up with a trip charge. It was very annoying there is nobody to complain to. I was charged for a trip when I wasn't in the country for heaven sake. Many charges on my account to Uber company are pretty questionable. Once your bank details are loaded, you can't delete, this means they have access to your money anytime. Uber is a fraudulent company, I will continue to seek for justice until I see it.",1,0

"We are going on vacation soon and it was suggested by our resort that uber would be less costly than a taxi. I set up an uber account. Because I did not want to store a card number that was attached to my account or use a credit card that has thousands of dollars available to use I purchased a my vanilla visa debit card.  I talked to my vanilla and ask them if this would be a card I could use with uber. They assured me of the cards available this card would be the one to use.

I tried several times to set up the uber account using this card and they would not take it. Not only that but the customer service people totally suck at their job. Basically I was told to bad so sad - and at no time did anyone investigate if there was a reason why you can not use this type of card. they just said sometimes they just don't work use a credit card. This type of card is used by many to receive direct deposit of payroll instead of having a checking account. One would think that uber would do some investigation to find out why there is a problem. So if you want to try and protect yourself by using this type of card don't expect uber to try and help figure it out.  Worst service I've ever received. Given all the other bad things I've seen in the news lately about uber workers and the CEO this should not surprise me.",1,0

O and by the by the way all this time had me so damn late because I had to now take the train which if you don't know not all trains on Nj transit stop at the same locations so which an urber 25 min tops with traffic turned into 2 hours and 17 minutes.  I had to get a cab which to the train from my place 20$ where the whole urber ride was 13$ then round trip ticket 16$ then another 16 more for cab from train to appt back to train. Did I mention when I got back to train from appt. Yep you guessed had to wait 51 minutes for train then over 25 min on the ride when back to Dover instead of paying for another cab I waited yep 35 more minutes for my girl to pick me up. Thanks Urber could have been dropped off at station in the morning right on time then wouldn't havre been late and after appt got picked up on time from station. But instead of using train was going to take urber because it was the same price.  So I say again when your working it's great but it always has some sort of issue and no one to call you suck!!!!!

Anyway, I was charged a cancellation fee and immediately complained.  Respond #1 fored back immediately from ""SC"" saying we charged you correctly.  I said no you didn't and asked for a refund.  Hazel L provided me a credit, which would have been fine if that was the initial response, but since I needed to go through hoops, I demanded a refund back to my credit card.  Gretchen C responded that is against policy.

Mind you, I am a 400 dollar/month uber user (I used uber eats at work pretty often) so this absolutely blew my mind.  I can say that uber has officially lost a user forever, I hope the company implodes with the recent negative PR storm that has hit them.

When the cab arrived I realized it was sharing,initially I found it a little weird but I agreed to get into the car.the sharing drop was at prabhadevi.so I insisted the driver to drop me first since Wadala comes First.the driver agreed to drop me,but later said that the route on his phone was prabhadevi so he has to drop me 2nd.I told him I would like to get down and asked him how much did it cost.He said he will only be able to tell me once my trip ends.which i found ridiculously lame.Only if uber could come up with a better solution to cancel or discontinue the service.I had a bull$#*! experience will never travel uber in India atleast.WORST experience. 1)wasted 1.30mins of my time and will also recommend my family and friends not to take uber atleast in India.",1,0

"I lost my cell phone in an Uber vehicle on a vacation to Las Vegas.  Trying to track down the driver was a 12 day nightmare.  Uber's doesn't really have a customer service.  They have a few people available on twitter or a Uber lost item report that will eventually get a response.  First Uber does not have a lost item link of their website home page or App.  They also demand full rude detail, drivers name, date of trip, cost of trip, time of trip and pickup and drop off locations.  So if you lost your phone, and don't have access to their app or a computer your screwed.  I send various Uber contacts a minimum of 25 messages.  Only when I purchased another iPhone and another SIM card from my service provider could I go through the secure process to use my old phone number and get into the app to get the ride detail.  So I give them the detail that they could have looked up any time and they basically tell me that the driver has my phone and that I need to contact the driver through the app to get my phone back.  Then then scolded me for opening multiple threads containing the sMe issue and sId my case was closed.  I complained asking them how they could close my case when I do not have my phone back, they did not reply because they don't care.  I went through their "" contact the driver"" process 7 times over 4 days and no one ever answered.  Only on my 8th try did I reach the driver 12 days after it was lost in the car.  Uber is an arrogant, rude company that does not care about providing customer service.  The have no toll free numbers for customers and their online support is terrible.  They tell you that they have sent you several DM's.  I said I looked and could not find any Direct Messages from them.  That's because the messages are hidden in their app under a help link.  How are customers supposed to know that?  I now use Lyft and they are awesome and will never ever use Uber again.  I want to be very clear, the driver is not the problem, when I was finally able to reach him he was polite and very helpful.  This is all Uber's rude unfriendly business model",1,0

Allow me to clarify:
On Tuesday I called for a car at 10am. Without bothering to confirm my address, the driver came to the wrong place and left, without a call.

My first patient cancelled.
Today, the driver actually CALLED for directions... and cancelled. No message from Uber, so I stood there, on crutches, in the snow, waiting.
Then I couldn't connect to uber, AND THERE IS NO DIRECT TELEPHONE OR COMPLAINT NUMBER.

"Uber has been gradually allowing drivers with poor reviews to work fro them.  I have had safety issues and even a driver who was clearly under the influence, among other safety issues.  When I cancel a ride due to low review scoring by other passengers, they have charged me cancellation fees and refused to refund me the $2.  This happened three times in a row where I cancelled those trips within less than 24 hours.  Lyft allows me to cancel trips if I do not like the driver's review score and has now configured me to ride with drivers with a 4.6 score or above.  I will try Lyft, Cabify, Juno or Via before choosing Uber as I am sure other companies will come into the market and provide much better services to compete with Uber.",2,0

 5 year old son. Driver gets aggressive and doesn't want to drive us anymore after we waited for him for so long. I tell him not to yell as he is scaring the 5 year old and its at this moment that he cancels the trip and orders us to get out of his car.

 The 5 year old boy is getting out of the car with one leg on the ground when the driver decides to accelerate. This fool is playing a game with his 1500kg car and a 20kg child. We yell at him and I put the car in park so that he cant harm anyone. We advised him we will be taking it up with the Police.

 Its at this moment, like an infant, this driver begins playing the victim and starts pacing around his car while its in the middle of the road with doors open and hazards on. A tantrum for the adult who realises what he has done is wrong and illegal.

"Uber for me is so buggy that I can simply not use it. I can not get my head around how a billion dollar company can not build a working app or website. 

Bug (design flaw) 1: you need to request permission through support to use the mobile website as a rider.
Bug 2: right now, the entire help.uber.com website is down. For hours. What?!
Bug 3: once you've been granted ""permission"" to use the mobile web-interface for rides, there is no way to change your phone number. There's an ""edit"" button for the phone number on the non-mobile website, but this then tells you to go to the app (which you can't use, that's why you're using the mobile site, durrrr).

Bug 4 (design flaw): once you've signed up with Uber there is no easy online way to delete your Uber account. I've looked into this and you actually need to contact support (the same support who's webpage is completely down right now) and write them an email saying you want your account deleted. Really?! In 2017? 

They're a billion dollar company but their website and software is worse than that written by a startup full of 12 year olds in their moms basement. I feel sorry for any talented coders working under Uber's obviously out of control ""manage""ment.",1,0
"I have a issue with one of my ride which I was wrongly charged. But Uber is not giving me such option where I can write about this or even ask about it. On 17th of jan., 2017 i booked a uber from besent nagar, Chennai to Hotel leela Palace, mrc nagar. First rate estate was showing approx INR 60 but receipt came of INR 130. 
Then i checked and found that driver started the meter from where he got that i request a cab and drop location was also wrong, he stopped the meter somewhere else after droped me at my location. 
My email id is tanwarvikas00@gmail.com",1,0
"I am Active Duty Army. I tried to apply to be a driver for Uber. They will not accept my valid drivers license. My license has an expectation date of 00/00/0000 because under Tennessee law it does not expire until I exit the service. Uber's automated email system kept telling me that it was expired. When I emailed the help line, I got an email back saying this:

""we understand that you had a question about requesting an exception to our requirement for a valid State driver's license. I'm afraid that we are currently unable to allow exceptions to this requirement. We know that Active Duty Service Members may relocate frequently. While many local regulations recognize this, these terms do not necessarily apply beyond personal driving.""

There is nothing wrong with my license, I am not asking for an exemption. My license is valid. 

On top of that I had to jump through hoops to get my account reset because when I drunkenly set it up the first time I put in the wrong email.

So I am beyond fed up with this company. I'm moving to Lyft!",1,0
"I see there are four cabs near my home still 2x surge !!! Switching to Ola.
If this continues uber will shut down soon.",1,0
The service and availability is good but they put exorbitant fare almost every day. Practically useless for daily commuters.,1,0
"This review is not just about the airport pick up, but in general for people who wish to know how to travel.

The best and only taxi company that I would recommend is Blue Bird, they are great! They always use the meter and the drivers are professional

The other taxi companies (dark blue, purple, grey colour taxis, not the light blue - blue bird taxis) are all rip offs!  Be careful, they are scammers and rude 99% of the time.

Ok now onto Uber, it can be great and it can be not so great, I would say 75% of the time it is good, but if you get one of these drivers look out -

Booked a Uber ride at 6.09pm with driver ""I Dewa Made Satrya"" to pick up from Nikki Beach Club, after waiting at the front of the club for 10 mins it was clear he was not coming as his vehicle which was 1km away was not moving in our direction, but I was surprised when the app changed to being on the journey, a few minutes later it finished but I was charge 15,000 rah (of course you waste time and write to uber the they refund it, but why should loyal passengers need to go through such crap when it is clearly not their fault?)

I then booked Uber again at 6.19pm, the same driver ""I Dewa Made Satrya"" accepted the booking but this time, he messages me on WhatsApp to tell me unless i pay cash he is not coming, so I try to change the payment method to cash but this is not allowed on the Uber app, so when I tell the driver this he says unless I pay him cash he will not come!!  He then asked me to cancel, but luckily it is within the 5 min BS time limit so I am not charged a cancellation fee this time (even though again it is not my fault!)

I advised the driver ""I Dewa Made Satrya"" that the service is terrible, he told me he does not care and when I said I would report this service to Uber he said ""I do not fear"", clearly Uber does not care for passenger service and is happy to hire anyone in Bali as a driver, as I would never employee someone with such an attitude, especially when now 18 hours later he just sent me another offence message to my phone ""You Emang Top""

Anyway avoid the driver ""I Dewa Made Satrya""with phone number +62 821 4407 1347

I then attempted to make another booking, this time it was picked up by driver ""Nyoman"", this booking was at now 6.29pm, this driver was 8 minutes away and started driving to my location, so I was thinking great finally have a driver, he was within about 3 minutes away and then I noticed he kept going passed the turn off and when I contacted him he said he is not coming, I could see on the app he was like 3 mins away, then 6 mins, 9 min, 12 min and clearly not coming to Nusa Dua but driving to Ulawatu, this driver just ignored all contact from me via message/phone, just keep driving and I guess waiting for me to cancel, which I finally did, clearly another driver that does not care for passenger service

Please avoid ""Nyoman"" driver and his number is +62 812 3786 5029, he clearly does not care and should not be allowed to drive for Uber.

Ok so finally made another booking with Uber, it is now 6.40pm, the guy turns up, very nice driver, but as I got into the car and sat down my daughter was just getting into the car and the driver starts to drive off, without her being in the car, the door was still open, my daughter then hit the road and was left on the street, this was clearly an accident but careless driving from Uber, I will not write his name, as he was nice, but clearly not careful.

Anyway basically after about 4 bookings, waiting 40 minutes, writing to uber for refund for my 15,000 Rph, we made it home to the villa in seminyak.

Honestly i love Uber, use it all over the world, however, I think in some cities like China (especially Beijing), Bali and Sydney the server now is terrible and the prices are on the increase so a taxi can be about the same!!!!  Once uber gets the marketshare they want they increase the prices without warning!",1,0
Why is it if they take money out of your account for the Uber rides that they have to take additional money which they say it's an authorization hold but they do not put it back for at least eight days and this is money that I cannot access and another thing if you have an Uber gift card they still want to put monies from the ride from your checking account on hold  when it is confirmed that they will get paid by the Uber gift card. I have for three weeks been trying to resolve this problem on two separate situations and the customer service is horrible. Isn't it illegal for them to keep a hold on your  money even after they get paid for the services of an Uber driver taking you to your destination. And why does it take so long for it to drop off from your checking account they should confirm you have the money then debit your account for the Uber ride and then that's it. I am trying to find out  how to issue an official complaint against Uber because of the situation can you please help,1,0
"My first experience with uber was absolutely horrible. A driver by the name of Wylder picked up myself and a friend and we were under the impression this was a safe, comfortable and convenient way to get to our location. It was not. The car (ford focus) was in horrible shape, the seats were tore up and covered in nasty stains. The vehicle smelled like cigarette smoke so bad I could hardly breath, and the driver was very unprofessional. He didn't use GPS and asked if we minded if he picked up a 3rd passenger on our way, we accepted since there was room, but then Wylder drove around for 30+ min looking for this other potential ""client"". He finally drove back to the location that he picked us up at and said ""I am suppose to be looking for a girl named Brittany""... umm, That would be me! He didn't seem to know what he was doing one bit. I felt very unsafe with his driving ability as he was all over the road and made sharp sudden turns in the wrong direction on several occasions. With this being my first experience with uber, I was very dissatisfied and probably wont be using the services again",1,0
"I drive for uber in Orlando. My car is always clean, safe and I received a lot of great feedback from passengers. I driven all over Orlando many times very late at night only for uber to keep all my earning and display that I owe them. I've had to spend for a lot of gas and tolls, new breaks, tires, deep cleaning because of messes made by  some passengers and when I ask where are my earnings I get a bs response. It's as if I been doing favors for people driving them around all for nothing. I'm going to find out who I can talk to so I can file suit again uber",1,0

"I requested an Uber ride on Thursday the 15th 2016 to take me from my home in Apopka Vineland to a Dentist Office in Dr. Phillips. The Uber arrived and took me to an address that I explained to him did not appear to be the correct address as it appeared to be that of a private home in a private neighborhood instead. I tried to explain this to the Uber driver, however, very rudely he requested assured me that that was the correct address. I got out of the vehicle to check the place out and see if it was the office, but, the Uber turned around and left me there (IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE!!!!) 

I contacted Uber on their contact line to tell them about their experience on repetitive occasions, however, to this day 23rd of the month no one ever did. This is quite unbelievable for me as I have been riding with Uber for a long time and dedicated; but if I ever have something like an outstanding balance with them they never play to hurry notify me for their funds. All I wanted was for someone to return my messages so I could state my case. Was that too much to ask for???",1,0
"Emailed them about an issue with Uber Pool (Driver name Tejan in Mitsubishi Lancer in DC metro area on Saturday night at 8:14pm) and was promised internal investigation  but they didn't contact me after that, shared a trip with another 3 people instead of 2, all drunk, one of them with a drink in his hand. I am a girl and was not willing to make an issue and was hoping the driver will do something but he didn't open his mouth to stop the F Words coming from the mouth of the men instead he opened the window and let us freeze in the cold because of alcohol smell. Inappropriate touching due to us crammed in the back, their girlfriend was in between but the guy with a drink kept his arms around her reaching to my shoulder. Uber customer service is a joke.",1,0
"VERY UNPROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE FROM UBER'S SUPPORT. On 12th December 2016, I have registered with Uber and uploaded a valid credit card. On the same day. The same day, Uber disabled my account and suspended too. There is no Phone Number listed to contact Uber Support. The only mode of correspondence is email communications. Uber support team never gave a valid reason for suspending my account. This is nothing but HARRASMENT on part of an International Company.

This has happened 15 out of 20 rides.",2,0
"For myself Uber has been a pleasant surprise. After reading through a hundred plus reviews and watching a few YouTube related videos(hysterical). I found myself uncertain if I wanted to join the Uber Brigade. The reviews seemed for the most part, to be negative. Not enough pay, a lot of down time etc. For myself, Everytime I flip on the Uber app it's non stop, until I stop. However I live in Toronto and I only use it part time. I have a full time gig. If I work Uber its 2 to 4 hrs a night Monday to Thursday at ""rush hour"".Friday I go 5pm until 10pm and start back up at 2-2:30am and work for a few more hours. Saturday repeat and Sunday is always busy up until 4pm. The rate varies for me but I base it by the day. It's been as low as $18 an hour and as high as $35 an hr. I don't always work the best times but I'm still averaging $21 an hr. After my first month. If you work the right times you can make $25-35 an hour, for me a perfect effortless part time job. The people are great. I always offer water and candy.  Anyway if you're reading this and contemplating just check it out what do you have to lose. Here's my reference number you'll receive a minimum $50 incentive after your first 10 rides. Or at least that's what my incentive was.

I want my personal info off this site. I believe my identity has been stolen by an Uber employee as well as fraud being committed.  If this is true, this employee has used my name my SSN, my DOB and my DL# to apply for credit accounts.
Thus far this person has has applied for 3 credit cards: Target, Finger Hut and Pay Pal. I found out this news today. A person of high authority at UBER needs to find out which Uber employee has stolen my identity and committed fraud. 
I began my Uber Driver application on  August 31st.  The city I applied to to drive in is Albuquerque, NM.  Thus far my application is incomplete.  I did provide my DOB, SSN and DL#. Additional, I provided a picture of my driver's license. 
Furthermore, the phone number that has been texting me daily is (256)826-0524.
Please investigate this illegal matter promptly as well as respond back to me ASAP.

Delete my Active Partner Albuquerque Account IMMEDIATELY. I do not want other any other UBER Employeesor hackers to steal my identity.

From my my DL this personhas my previous address (which is only on DL), my DOB, my DL #

Additionally, as I stated before you should beinvestigating your employees who have access to my personalinformation.  I did file a police reportfor identity theft on 9/21/16.  I foundout about my identity theft on the 9/20/16.

Lastly, I do not understand how it is possible for me to have an active account when I have not provided my car insurance nor have I had by vehicle inspected.

Good Morning Silas,
At the top of the last email that you sent me what did the following statement mean: ""Your request (192809225) has been updated.""  Does this mean that all my account information has been deleted as I have twice requested? If it has not been, please provide confirmation that it has been. Or what is the specific task that has been updated?  
I know as yesterday, that UBER still has my email address because I received the following email which is below:

Concerning the text that I have been getting daily from (256)826-0524 is this number an official UBER number and is the following address for vehicle inspection legitimate: 2300 Centre Ave. SE, Albuquerque, NM 87106?
Thank you for your immediate attention,Danielle

Hi Danielle,

Happy to help here.

I do apologize for the trouble, but we're unable to have the riders' account deleted due to the fact that you have a drivers' account that is active.

So what I'll do is send your drivers' account to the respective team and have it cancelled then do the same for the riders' account.

So just sit tight while we look after this for you.

Speak soon.

Good Morning Olena,
As I have stated in several of my prior emails to UBER Support, I do not understand how my account is ACTIVE when I have not submitted my car insurance nor have I had my vehicle inspected.  Please respond to this question.  Additionally, in my last email I asked if the number that has been texting me is legitimate. The number that has been texting me daily is (256)826-0524. Please respond to this question as well. The third question that you need to respond to me on is this following address for vehicle inspection legitimate: 2300 Centre Ave. SE, Albuquerque, NM 87106?
My email on the account is the one that I have been corresponding to UBER Support with, ..........and my cell is ...........
Please directly respond to the questions that I have asked.
Thank you,                Danielle

Soon I found my Uber account was inaccessible and they replied that I need to email them the scanned copies of my government ID and credit card.

It appears that your account has been suspended for activity that violates our Terms and Conditions and will be unavailable for you to use until further notice.

"We travel quite a bit and used Uber always. It was so easy, fast pick up, clean cars, nice drivers, roomy cars, some had amenities like hard candy, and courteous drivers.  Right now three of us are crammed in a small car listening to the drivers personal conversation. We waited 10 minutes for him even though the app said three minutes away. Yesterday from the airport we were listening to the drivers music which was load and not appropriate for my son. It was loud and w asked her to shut if off but she just turned it down. Then I would crack my window and she kept shutting it. Is it NYC Uber or is it like this everywhere?  One more try maybe but then back to yellow cabs.",3,1
Without a doubt the worst experience of my life with Internet based services. Drivers in NYC either can't follow directions or have difficulty conversing in English.

I have sent them screenshots of my bank into and screenshots of it entered into the Uber system. 100% match. Still, the can't pay me. They tell me to go to the local Uber office, which I do. They verify that my banking info is 100% correct. So, they suggest I go to my bank. I do that. The bank verifies that the info I have given Uber is 100% correct and everyone is scratching their heads because they can't understand why Uber can't pay me the hundreds of dollars they owe me.

After visiting the Uber office nearest to me, I was given a promise that the charges would be reversed and my account would be cancelled. After 3 days, the charges were reversed, but Uber refused to cancel my account. Now, more charges are being accrued and Uber customer service is again refusing to respond personally to my complaints. Guess I will be making another trip (this will be the 3rd) to the home office closest to me.

"We called an Uber to head to the San Jose airport as we often do. Our first driver showed up and asked us where we were going and we said San Jose airport. Immediately he said he is ""going to have to pass"" since he wants to get home soon. He didn't want to take us that far. I find this appalling - the airport is a 18 miles, 20 minute ride away. If he didn't want to accept passengers then why did he accept our ride? We wasted 8 minutes Waiting for him for nothing. 

We then called another Uber and she came after 5 minutes. She also asked us where we were going and when we told her the airport she said she had to pass because she didn't have proper authorization to make trips to the airport. Needless to say we were pretty pissed at this point but decided third time's a charm. 

The third driver was 5 minutes away. We called him right then and there and specifically asked him if the airport as a destination was going to be a problem. He said ""I think it's ok"". Then a couple minutes later we got a cancellation notice. That is THREE DRIVERS in a row that refused to give us a ride based on our destination. It's not like we were asking to go 100 miles away. SJC is the closest airport to the Fremont area and there was no traffic at this time of day. 

We ended up using Lyft and even with a 75% prime time charge, we knew we would get reliable service and a driver that was courteous and would take is to where we needed to go. And that is exactly what happened. Our Lyft got us there swiftly and with no issues or complaining about the destination. Uber, you have LOST this customer. I find this appalling and completely unprofessional. One cancellation I can maybe understand and brush off as a specific driver issue. 3 in a row means there is something systemic going on and that your customer service model is broken. Take care of your drivers so they take care of your customers. 

Completely unacceptable and unprofessional. Doesn't seem like there's enough reprimanding for drivers canceling on riders. Use Lyft or alternatives and stay away from Uber.",1,0

Double what it cost several times. 20 minute ride each way,no traffic. Can't call,all you can do is email!

While on a trip tried to use uber without success. There were 5 of us so we needed (according to the website XL or SUV would work) so I selected one in our area and it gave me their phone number.  I called to make sure they would be able to accomodate all of us and the driver said no so i ended up calling the local cab company. Wasted time researching and frustration due to the fact i cant remove my credit card information now! Once its entered you can add more however there is no way to remove it and apparently no customer service!?!,2,0

I have recently been using uber in Panama central America it has turned into a nightmare experience not only with drivers but also with Uber Support personal.  one driver charged me 10 dollars for  a fare that has been costing me  only 3dollars I made a complaint and instead of supporting me they blocked me from something the driver said about me. He was not the person on the profile also and obviously just a friend of the taxi Uber Driver.  I found the app malfunctioned so many times that it caused distress to me. The drivers were so rude that they never answered calls or texts.  One taxi driver went to wrong place and did not respond to me I waited for an hour for an arrival but he never turned up.  The Uber Support personal are also rude and don't listen to your complaint properly I was actually blocked from using uber because of a driver telling lies about me.  I have never been treated so awfully by a taxi service in my entire life.,1,0

Tonight I booked a cab in Manchester with a £12-14 quote and he was 8 minutes away, when he was 2 minutes away the quite suddenly became subject to a x 1.7 surge price and had I not seen it and got in the cab I would have been charged accordingly! There is NO WAY this is legal altering a quote last minute as you did last time to tell me I was wrong! I have 2 witnesses before you dare argue!! This is a con it will be posted on Facebook and I WILL be contacting trading standards! If a price surge is in effect it has to be applied at the time of booking not surreptitiously afterwards!!!!!

I use UBER  frequently but this last time I was accused by a White driver that her property was stolen from her car. UBER contacted me to tell me my account had been canceled. I tried to contact UBER but they never replied back.,1,0
"Uber ripped me off! Applied ""surge charge"" of 2.2x the fare but there was no prior notification of this in the app. I was not informed and did not grant permission for this. The app only showed a fare estimate of £7-9. I got home to find that a taxi journey that ALWAYS costs me around £7-9 had cost £22.50, already charged to my card and I had no means of recourse in the app. I had to go onto their website to file a ""report a serious issue with you driver"" case to get to a human and they didn't read anything of what I had written - just robotic copy and paste answers! I threatened to take it further and finally got the surge charge refunded but they said it would be a one-time gesture only, so this could happen again and I'd simply be screwed. They made out that they were doing me a massive favour and I was just lying about not being notified of the surge fare.
The next day (today), bizarrely I got an email through: ""Hi xxxx, To ensure your security, we have reset your password. To log into Uber, you will need to choose a new password.""
Then when I try to reset this I get the following: ""SOMETHING WENT WRONG. There has been an error, and we are currently looking into it.""
However others can log into their accounts using this same computer/same IP. I then checked the app and it was not accessible to me either, so they have killed my account it seems because I demanded my money back. It's fine by me because there wasn't going to be a next time anyway, but what a crooked, horrible company! Avoid!Tip for consumers: Don't go there!!! Save yourself the hassle.",1,0

"We were in Florida for the past week.  We don't drink and drive so we used Uber on any evening we were going out.  Half of the drivers (men) were wonderful.  Knew their way around, friendly, awesome people.  The other half (women) didn't know where they were, didn't speak English, depended on me for directions, charged me extra because they got lost several times.  This is not a sexist comment for I am a woman!  We are not sure we will continue to use Uber.  The cost is less than a taxi but the frustration isn't worth it.  Uber needs to make sure whomever they hire actually knows the area where they are working!  Awful when you've been out having a good time, and then have to do your own work to get back to your hotel.  Stupid freaking drivers.  don't drive it you don't know where you are - common sense!",3,1
"You have to be kidding! I was here waiting and the driver's car drove right past us! I am not paying for this cancellation. I literally chased this guy down there street and he said too bad and cancelled my ride. Then uber charged me $5???

"Really Disgusting! This is the condition of National Capital Region, the biggest frustration people facing here is conveyance and moreover traffic. Nobody is hell bothered about 9-10 hours of jobs extending to 12, 13, 14, 15 hours and so on. 
A person going to office or market thinks to book Uber/ Ola, the first question the driver asks is DROP KAHA KA HAI- i.e. Where is your drop location. Whereas, its clearly mentioned in Ubers rule book that the driver is not suppose to ask the drop location, not a big deal the rules are as fake as the company is. After waiting for 10-15 minutes, either the driver switches his mobile off, or standing at one position he will say that I am not able to track your location or even he will just sit over it and cancel the trip after 15 min with no intimation. This is not something that happens once or twice a week, this is something that happens twice/ thrice a day. Then for all the cancelled trips they will deduct 80/- (per trip), now if a person doesnt have the time to write them the incidence happened, they will not even return the money back.

Even after my last complain to uber, I attached the screenshots and sent them, these people apologized and gave me vouchers to close the matter and said that this will not happen again. But what next, everytime I should write them such detailed mail so that they pay attention to this, they dont even have a customer care. Moreover the driver has the guts to say that JAO KAR DO COMPLAIN or Okay, Jisse kehna hai kaho. Because what worst, just that they will not get the days incentives, nothing more then that. Everybody is just into money printing business, and who is the sufferer, just the common man.

Frustrated person, at last when goes to an auto wala so either he will be on strike or he asks for money as per his choice, because there are no rules. Nobody is there to check. Why is the common man working so much, just to get frustrated and depressed, for he is helpless for so many things and at last he should be happy that he has money to get admitted in a branded hospital. Anybody in India can strike for any non sense thing demanded, what should a common man do. Leave all his work and strike for the thousand things that he has to face because of wrong people into business. What is the government doing.

"When I saw an ad online for the soon to be Uber delivery service, I was intrigued enough to sign up. What I did not know is it would take TWO DAYS to sign up! I started at home taking pictures of the documents they wanted and sending them. Four hours later pulling in for coffee, the first text started for me to resend the pictures. Then hours later at my volunteer job, I was doing it again. Even when I got home, this continued into the night, with emails as well. Just how many times do you need to send the requested pictures until your account goes from pending to activated? It's not that I don't have patience, it's just multiple communication can become irritating and annoying. It took THREE DAYS  (after angry communication from me to them to please STOP!) to find out it was multiple computer generated messages. Have patience if you want to try and sign up with Uber. And don't have a temper like I do!",3,1

Uber is literally looting it's customers in the name of SURGED FARES in PUNE. After 6:30 evening whenever you try to book an Uber Cab...fares are surged. Starting from 1.2 X(available for minutes only) it goes to 2.6X till 8 pm and that too in norm days..leave aside in rains even if there are cabs available in that area. I don't understand it's parameters of surging. In a minute you see 1.2X surged fare and the next minute that fare expiresand you have to pay 2.4X. People you can try it yourself.

"Please think twice before you become a partner with uber,and don't be a fool of believing them that you can earn 60,000rs per month. 
 Here is the business model for fooling partners. 
you earn 2000 per day,  i.e 60000 per month 
uber commission is 20% i.e 12,000 rs  
service tax is 5% i.e 3000rs 
now you are left with 45000 rs 
you need to spend at least 600 rs for diesel every day,as you need to move your vehicle continuously in search of trips 
Now you are left with 27,000 rs
You need to pay your emi, say 12,000. 
You are left with 15000 rs
so you can earn 15,000 rs if you drive 14 hours a day.
if you are planning to get a driver then you might have to pay your e.m.i from your pocket. 
and after all this please remember you are not gurranted to earn 2000rs daily. 
and due to a tuugh competition given by ola now it has become very difficult to earn even 1200 - 1500 per day.

Today I feel I was taken advantage of by UBER.  I am a loyal uber customer who has used UBER many times for work and personal use.  I have never run into what happened to me this morning with a ride charge of $68.97 US in New York.  When I requested a ride I was told the fair was approx $18 from my hotel to LGA Airport.  A surcharge screen then came up which advised me a 2.3 surcharge would apply to this rate.  I didn't understand it and read it as an additional 2.3%.  Now I am advised that it means actually an additional 2.3 rate.  Even at that 2.3 rate $18x2.3=$41 not $68.97.  When I received the uber receipt after the fact I was charged $68.97.  I would have never agreed to this.  A normal cab ride was $40.  I feel violated and cheated by Uber. This system is not set up right and is very confusing for the customer.  I won't be using UBER again as the company after numerous attempts will not help.,1,0

"hi

Good to have your services in share too and for the last two days i am enjoying my to and fro rides , with competitive rates .

  you have clubbed me with another rider who was in a different direction

for eg.;;   my (second) booking was from Income Tax towers, AC Guards to Manikonda  which is of some 13 kms plus
     In the first booking , the cab's destination was Janapriya Utopia via  Attapur Road 
 And then he drove me from towards langar houz and proceeded to nekhnampur from there to Manikonda, nearly covering some 20 kms in the traffic.  

These two designations are poles apart.  Ofcourse sharing is always time consuming.  I do agree    
But that should also be properly connected in the same route or beyond one destination or may extend to the bye lanes.

Definitely that cannot be coupled with this type of  two different directions , that too in this hyderabad traffic in the peak hours.  

So my advice is to refine the connectivity so that there will be more no. of commuters 



And again on second occasion, today you have clubbed me with another who travels to entirely a different destination

Today also the same thing happened 
you have clubbed customers travelling in two different routes thereby causing chaos between us and good amount of delay in the travel.  I picked up at 9.00 

IF YOU POOL CUSTOMERS TOGETHER WITH DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.  Really this is not expected from you 
YOU WILL BE A FAILURE IN UBER POOL

GO DOWN MY BOOKING HISTORY AND ESPECIALLY TODAY'S ROUTE AND IF YOU HAVE ANY CONCERN FOR CUSTOMERS TRAVELLING IN POOL, YOU WILL NEVER RESORT LIKE THIS

This is my second mail.  and which i expect turn a new leaf

If you dont improve,  your efforts of pooling will go unnoticed

Also, UBER is a terrible corporate citizen. .85 cents a mile/.75 cents for UBER Pool plus .13 per minute means that when you deduct .575 cents a mile while riders are in the car and .575 cents per mile to get to the rider, you'll LOSE MONEY ON EACH AND EVER RIDE!  This means a full time UBER Driver will never pay a dime in taxes, qualify for Social Security or have any money in life.  All full time UBER drivers will end up a burden to the government while their cars have been polluting the environment.  

The Wussy County Commissions all across the country that have rolled over for this company are anything but public servants.  They are fools.  If you want a cheap ride, do not care about taking advantage of other humans and like rewarding a greedy morally bankrupt corporation, by all means, continue too use UBER.  

Also, UBER Pool -- You get into a car with people you don't know and a driver you don't know.  You go on a route you don't need to go on.  As a driver, you're a rolling day care center for drunks.  UBER Company calls us drivers partners.  That's CRAP.  They treat us as if we're illiterate, mentally challenged minors.   They lie, threaten, and constantly sell lie after lie after lie.  My prediction is UBER will continue to have success for a long time ahead but will come to be vilified as the horrific example of greed that they are.  

Their treatment of people and disregard for our environment, our laws, and most of all the safety and well being of their drivers is as egregious as any company in the history of America.  The Pussy Politicians that are rolling over for this company are also an embarrassment to our country.",1,0
"I've had countless issues with uber drivers claiming false cancellations, claiming to have picked me up when they hadn't, etc. Tonight a guy picked me up and immediately started hinting that I lived too far away. Mid way through the ride he finally concluded that I did,in fact, live too far away (he just wasn't familiar with the New York area at ALL- NO, Brooklyn isn't in Manhattan). He kicked me out of the car in the middle of the night in a bad neighborhood and cancelled the ride. I had to walk with my three heavy bags all the way home because of other issues with false cancellations and uber. Lyft isn't much better but fewer terrible experiences for sure.",1,0
"Too much words are needed to explain about this big scam ,whether you are a driver or a rider.  I have experienced both sides. Uner is collecting your information and selling them and ripping off the driver and the rider both!  Stay away from this evil at any cost !",1,0
"First, I requested an Uber driver that was 6 minutes away from me in an appropriate amount of time before I needed to get to my destination. I needed to be at the airport by 8:30 a.m. and contacted Uber at 7:40. I didn't want to have to pay for parking at the airport. When I requested the Uber driver I saw that he has 4 out of 5 stars and figured he would be a good driver. 
    However, the driver seemed to be lost and had no clue where he was. He passed my street four times, which my street is not that difficult to find! He kept making U-turns and turning down the wrong streets. 
   For a driver, you're suppose to know where you're going! And if you don't know, follow the GPS! It was an awful experience that I had with Uber. I had to pay an outrageous price for parking at the airport and was late for my flight! If the driver just knew where he was going or knew how to use a GPS then this issue wouldn't be an issue!
    Since I canceled the Uber ride they want to charge me for a cancelation fee! Uber really needs to test their drivers to see if they're smart enough to use a GPS. Although, you'd think it would be common knowledge... I guess not.",1,0
"It is a ripoff for both drivers and riders. Uber gets the money and your car and pocket suffers. Not to mention the safety issues. I drove for Uber for two days; 4 rides. Up to 19 per hour?? Not even close! More like 2.00 per hour not mention you only get paid for the ride to the riders to their destination. The rest is on you!

"I used this once in America, I was advised to get the app which I did. 10 months later they have taken nearky £300 out my bank account.!!!. I'm. In touch with the fraud team now it's stress I can do without...",1,0
I have used Uber a few times and I found it very expensive. I have order taxi and it showed me it was arriving in a few minutes but then it stated that it has been cancelled. I have ordered one again today and it has gone to wrong address. I was advised to change address on the system but Uber would keep on showing the wrong address. I have set the address many weeks ago and and travelled to/from same work address but today it is a different story because it is same street but different area. I have been charged £3-50 for Users poor system. I will not use Uber again just waste of time and money.,1,0
"Uber drivers are not held to the same standards as cab drivers.  They often cancel your ride and the company will put the charge onto your credit card. I have been trying to get 2 of those charges off of my card now for months with no resolution, having sent at least 8 emails to numerous individuals. It seems like you can never connect with the same person to solve your problem and there is absolutely no way to make contact by phone. I also tried to get an Uber out of the country and the guy just never showed. Another driver had no idea how to get to the airport that was 15 minutes away and took a route that took over an hour and I was almost late for my flight.  Be wary travelers!",1,0
"I live in melbourne australia. i had a early morning hospital appointment today. only my seccond time using the service and i will never use again. it cost me double it would have had i waited for a cab. incidently the app told me i would be altered to a drop in surge if any in 30 mins!! in that time i could have and should have called a normal taxi.clear scam there considering this service is supposed to be on demand and i did not have the time to wait aroung for 30  mins for ubers claculations. but i wwas not prepared for it to be so outragously overpriced.
i believe the app scams by telling you to wait till the surge drops or pay a series of charges. I'm on my way to the hospital waiting in the cold i dont have time to break down the charge list nor did i expect that in such a short distance i would be charged double.
  what should have been a 25 dollar fare to over 50!!!  
we caught a cab on the way back it was quick , hassale free and fare appropiate. UBER you just lost a customer and i will be letting others know about my experience.",1,0
"We took an uber home thinking it would be better than driving. It was a 25.09 ride which is absolutely fine, but a surcharge of over 50 dollars is absolute ridiculous.

So disappointed in the company.",1,0
two days after using uber for transportation I checked my bank account and noticed seven un authorized fraudulent activities on my account.  Be careful with giving out you financial information when setting up your account.,1,0
"App login issue, registration issue. Customer service has no phone number. To solve simple problems, you will see several non sense emails. No one will solve your problem. Bottom line , bad company, they do only show as a good customer service but have no solution for customer. DONT USE UBER, ITS A TROUBLE.",1,0
Uber is totally taking advantage and overcharging! They charged me over $100 for 10mile ride! Ridiculous!,1,0
"I was at the airport and figured I would try Uber ..first guy ..we went around in circles 
Trying to navigate the map.. I don't
Know where I am at the airport they say you can contact the driver or text I couldn't
Second driver same thing ..you would think one of them would call me they could see I was still standing lost ..never ever again at least real cab drivers call you and let you know where to go and where they can meet you.. I hope they do not charge
Me doe those two cancelations that would be the icing on the cake.. Uber you suck

"A few week ago my boyfriend had ordered me an uber ride home. It was very late, and when I had gotten in the cab, the driver seemed really aloof and tired. I was very courteous, asked him how his night was, and the response I got was very groggy and rude. Regardless he started driving and when he hit over 50mph in a 25mph school zone, I started getting a bit uncomfortable and concerned. I asked politely if he could slow down and again, he answered with a rude tone of voice.

A few days go by and I get a call from my boyfriend asking why he was charged $165.00 !!!!! The driver had accused me of vomiting in his car!!! And took ""fake photos"" and sent them to uber! It was appalling! And the photos he took looked like a crime seen it was so disgusting. It looked liked mushy popcorn and water, and the guy even went so far to smear it all over his car. Was just so gross. 

Never in my life have I thrown up in someone's taxi cab, and if I had felt sick, I would have politely told the man to pull over. I was not sick, I was not drunk, and I remember the ride clearly. Nothing along those lines had happened and I am shocked uber let him get away with something so terrible. Not only did he accuse an innocent passanger, but tried to steal money from my boyfriends account. TERRIBLE!!!!!",1,0
"I have been driving for uber for over nine months it was bad enough when they lowered the rates for our work, I got past that and kept on driving... Well last week in my review, they. Gave me a low score saying a rider said my vehicle didn't meet their standard of cleanliness, this was not true because I am constantly cleaning my vehicle and passengers are always ccomplementing me on. How fresh my vehicles smells, after passengers are in and out of your vehicle you will realistically have some sand in the floor, there is no way to logically and safely vacuum your car out between the hours of 10pm and 4am that's makes no sense which is what they tried to suggest to clean the car after each fare.  How?? If u get trips back to back when do you clean of course if someone vomits you're going to clean that mess up... But to top it off when they said the car wasn't clean they took the opportunity to throw in There saying remember your PERSONAL HYGIENE as well, which was not even the comment.. I was personally offended and have not driven sense.. I am a clean person and just because my car was not emuculate enough for one rider shouldn't have turned into the opportunity to insult me... I know it was an automated response, but those two responses need to be separated from each other because they are two separate issues...",1,0
"Uber did not get my payment because the credit card was outdated. I would like to solve the matter but have not been able to do this on line. I am not going to spend 10 hours on line trying to figure this out since I am not that technical. A number to reach Uber would be nice.
The only reason I gave 3 stars was because the driver was great. Customer service??????????...There is absolutely no customer service!!!..really..none! You will never ever be able to speak to anyone. If your question is not in their category of FAQ's then forget it. So how does that make you feel as a customer?  Sounds to me like they don't want to talk to the people who are making their business grow. They are now on my do not call list.Tip for consumers: Call a taxi. At least you can talk to a human being if an issue happens.",3,1

I wait for 15 mins she did not cancel the trip. until she cancel the trip I can not able to request for another driver.. because she accepted that she can not able to pickup me, then the right thing is she must cancel the trip.. but not even its happened in this case.. so she has done these many mistakes1) she don't have idea of area where she is going to pick up 2) though I'm giving her clear directions she did not found me
3) she accepted that she can not able to pick up me after my almost half an hour request.. but still she did not cancel the trip..
4) because of her unprofessional behavior she charged me cancellation fee.. she wasted my precious time..

"I am a UBER DRIVER in London. You people on here are complaining? You are getting the cheapest fares and got the nerve to complain!
Most of you people are racist wgen you see driver of another ethic and decide to give them a crap rating or worse bo rating at all!

You guys should not be complaining as you did not hire a executive car to trave 2 miles which costed you £20.
Do you expect the driver to bend over for you?

No one is stopping you to go else where but majority of you will run back to uber! 

Uber shoud kick out rider with anything less than 4.00 stars because i have seen plenty of rubbish rates riders. Why will a driver give you a bad rating?
1.Because you are rude
2. Miserable
3. Start to blame them for traffic when you are running late. 

4. You think the rider should kiss your ass .
5. you are traveling 2 miles.

Most low rates riders are WOMEN!

You are using uber because it is cheap! Get of your high  horse. 
Most of uber riders only travel short distances. 
It us a waste of our time!
We drivers are getting shafted...not you riders!",5,1

"So I used UBER last night...

NEVER USE IT!

I got dropped off by the first guy, before I could even put my seatbelt on (all of a sudden had to take his wife to work)

So I call another Uber (gives me a 2.5 times rate.... with no information on what the heck the rate is, NO OTHER OPTION - that or no UBER, and every time you search another one.. the rate gets higher and higher....)

I get home, there's no service.. I tip the guy decently in cash for getting me home finally

Get inside, my wifi loads up UBER receipt

$79!!!!!!! for a 15 minute ride...........

I'm in New York and trying to catch a cab to the airport.  It is pouring down rain and the taxis are busy.  I decided that I would try UBER.  The app kept timing out on my iPhone then it came up and said UBER Pool.  I'm thinking OK I will share a ride and save some money. LaGuardia is only 7.5 miles away and it usually about $35 for a cab fare.  It took about 15 minutes but I was willing to wait to I didn't miss my flight   I had a very nice driver and a nice car but he couldn't tell me how much.  I was the only passenger so I thought OK I got lucky and no one else is going to the airport since it said UBER Pool.  I had no other choices anyway.  I have a computer training business so I am very savvy with technology.  I arrived at the airport and he said it would compute the fee but he couldn't tell me how much because the app had also put in JFK and not LaGuardia which is not what I chose.  Maybe another potential customer not sure.  I got the receipt and was charge $179 for the short trip.  When I contacted UBER they said since it was busy they could charge me 3.6 times the normal fair.  That is really taking advantage of your customers.  I don't think my customers would be happy if I told them since they scheduled their training on a very busy day that my rate would be 3 or 4 times more than normal.  This is price gouging.  I will NEVER EVER use UBER again.,1,0
I have travelled with ola cabs was never cheated like this the driver made us pay the airport fee by cash 110 when it was alredy included in the.the bill was 286+110=396.when we paid 506=396+110,1,0

"Uber can be hit or miss.
On my first Uber ride:	Going out with friends from a hotel we were staying at in Savannah, Ga. They ordered a ride and it was a great experience, no problems and a courteous knowledgably driver. 
On the second night out: After receiving a ride downtown on the hotel shuttle, we had dinner and went out exploring the nightlife. Then we order Uber and the app said they were 10 minutes away, no problem. As we followed the drivers progress at about 5 minute out, he called to confirm our location and said hed be there shortly. A few minutes later his location was off and we did not see him on the app. We called back his number and he said he is going to take another fare and we need to find a different ride. What an SOB you are Biell! By this time we were tired and frustrated. We saw a taxi and took that back to the hotel.

"It's been 2 years that we are using uber, but the kind of issues we have faced in past 2 months have totally washed away the past 2 years of good experience. I'll explain the major episodes-
1. Maruti Ritz- Me and my husband were travelling  from sector 57 gurgaon and sec 14 gurgaon, my husband had to get down at huda city which was midway. There are 3 ways for this route, when we asked him to take the huda route he said i can't do this otherwise I'll be in loss, I'll move according to the navigation. We told him that this concept is for car pool, but he continuously kept on saying that you don't know, i am the employee i know. He continuously kept on howling ""mai apki wajah se apna nuksan thode na karaunga"". After damn frustration we asked him to call the customer care and ask, even after knowing the fact, what he again misbehaved and said that ""hum aisa isliye karte hain taki ap baad me ye na kaho k galat raste pe le gye navigation k hisab se"". He was not silent for a min till 3/4th the way. This is highly unacceptable.

2. We both had to travel from gurgaon to delhi, it was sunday eve not too much traffic also. We booked uber thrice. The first driver 6:08 pm when we called him after 5 min he said that he cant go to delhi.. in car pool its not possible.
Second driver 6:14 pm, we called him within 2 min, he also asked where u hv to go, i disconnected the phn. He again called to ask the destination, i didn't tell. He said ok, he was jst 5 min away, we kept on waiting for 10 min, no response,.when we called to check,  he switched off his phn. Then also we waited and kept on calling for 15 min then finally he cancelled the trip. 
Third driver 6:39 pm- he too was just 5 min away , for half an hour he kept on saying that i m searching whereas he was not. At last we asked him to reach rail vihar the nearest landmark, its clearly seen in the map, finally he replied "" madam mujhe search karna nahi ata"". Then i shouted and said that i am going to make a complain, he was at rail vihar within a min, bt we had already cancelled the trip.
We were late by 1 and a half hour, moreover we were damn frustrated.
Finally then i booked uber from my phn and we got the cab.

3. Today in the morning, i made a request for own car from sec 57 to 14 gurgaon. A driver mahinder, hundai accent accepted the request and said that its in pool and he is going to dwarka delhi. The rider he was having was also saying that i didn't opted for pool. He asked me to cancel, so i did. I was booking it for office, in hurry.
I again sent a request and again he only accepted and when i called him, he replied i have to take this request otherwise ""meri ye trip waste ho jayegi"" i don't know how. I said i havent opted for car pool, I'll be late for office how does it matters to me k apki trip waste ho jayegi. So what he replied was, he actually shouted that ""to mujhe kya farq padta hai k apko late ho raha hai"".
I have actually referred uber to many of my knowns, i now feel like writing these reviews everywhere. This is just not acceptable. These are only the major issues that i hv mentioned, and it actually doesn't matter if u cut their day's incentive when we are facing so many issues with so many drivers. They take advantage of your 6 trip incentive method and it will deteriorate uber's image, u should make it km based incentive method Uber is working only becoz of customers. Dont lose them.",1,0

Why is Uber such a fraud at pricing and worst at customer service?Please answer it.Being Billion Dollar industry and using treachery and fraud to charge customers?What happened to convenient ride at economic cost??For 2.5 km you might pay 100-120 Rupees(Indian)?Why because its peak time.IS it??I don't see any traffic on the road.Lol!! Their tantrums are worst than 11-year-old...I don't know what training their drivers receive.All they want is incentive and no attention to customer convenience,1,0

"Recently, the Uber rates were lowered to a rate that significantly beats the rate to the standard yellow taxis in the city (NYC). Yet Uber finds a way to always scam the customer with ridiculous markups for ""busy"" times, or ""in demand"" areas, etc. Mind you, we're not talking about a measly 50 cent or so surcharge, they actually double the estimate rate on many occasions. One day without paying attention you might end up having to pay $80 for what you've taken at a rate $40 on several occasions only because there were quite a few people requesting other drivers in that area at once. Seriously??  

The support is a complete joke. At least when I call a CC or my bank support, although I'm getting someone from Thailand or Singapore, someone actually picks up the phone. Uber doesn't even have a number! This is a company valued in the billions. Again...Seriously??

After you send the email for a charge dispute, they are very polite in telling you ""NO, our calculations are correct at present rider rates."" -Um NO, they're not if the more expensive rate setting alternative is cheaper.

Folks, don't fall for the ""trend"" of using Uber because many others are. Trend setters will wait on line for 3hrs to get a muffin because so and so celebrity gets their pastries there. Yea I know...really stupid. So don't be one of those. Plenty of alternative car services in this big city that'll actually pick you up with a SET rate to give you before they even come. 

Otherwise, the yellow cabbies are still cheaper.  No matter what BS marketing they try to pass you.Tip for consumers: Really check the price surges before scheduling a call!  They will trounce your card if you're not careful.  They are also known to cancel your account for cancelling charges with your bank or CC company.",1,0
"I have had some terrible experiences with the uber cab drivers. They are terrible with directions and they are extremely arrogant. 
Once a driver asked me to get off the cab because he thought I gave the wrong pick up address. And in another instance, the driver shouted at me because I told him to take a specific route. I have had many such experiences and so have my family members..

"We noticed UBER charges on our credit card for rides we did not take. Found out that we could not call UBER to notify them, only email.

UBER finally told us that a MISS MOM was using our account, or created their own account with our card. The ONLY fraud charges with the card were with UBER. They gave us zero peace of mind with their security systems with credit card information, basically we got the sense that there is NO security and they have NO sense of urgency when it comes to fraudulent credit card use. Luckily we have fraud protection with AMEX even though UBER will still try to hold us liable...Obviously Going to Lyft now.....UBER IS HORRIBLE",1,0

"Uber, a company valued at 61 billion dollars. Uber is very popular with their riders. The reason uber is so loved by their riders is because a uber ride is about 1/3rd the price of a taxi.
A uber rider can pay a minimum of $4.80 for a ride. A taxi would charge around $10.00 for the same ride.. A uber driver will average 10 minutes to go pick up a rider and take the rider to their destination and drop them off. Uber driver ends the trip and uber instantly displays how much the driver is paid, $2.40 for the trip. The trip will take around 30 minutes of your time. Now the driver has to pay for their gas, insurance, wear and tear  on their vehicle. After the driver figures in the expenses, he or she is left with a profit of zero!!
I have drove for uber part time for 2 years plus. In the beginning I easily made $350.00 a week. Now I average $75.00 a week and drive twice the miles to make that. Uber has not sent my 2015 1099's to report the income to the IRS. When you email uber about a problem, you will receive a robot answer. Uber does not care about their drivers. Uber only cares about increasing their $61 billion dollar value to $81 billion. I am a retired man and my advice to anyone who is considering driving for uber is......DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!! You will be better off flipping burgers at McDonalds.",1,0
"UberPOOL is a total scam and as a matter of fact, I think the algorithm is totally off in many cases. UberPOOL would charge me more than a UberX for exactly the same route during the same time of a week and the only difference is POOL wasted me twice the time for picking up the second passenger from THE AIRPORT, where we had to drive in and wait and pick up the other passenger from one of the terminals. I tried contacting customer service FIVE TIMES because it made no sense to me at all and I doubt whether any of the customer support people had any sense how the product actually works or even how to read at all, because none of them ever answered my question and instead just said very random and useless things to me. Dear Uber, please at least spend some money training your people because they made your company look very stupid and unprofessional. And to NYC passengers, take the yellow cab because they are at least registered officially and the pricing is transparent.",1,0
I was with family coming back home after shopping. We called uber the first time ever. The driver probably was drunk. He took totally a wrong route and when we said it's wrong he said he has to follow the directions which were shown on his uber device. He just kept driving and suddenly we found our selves on highway. I got worried and ask him to call some one he said he can't do that. He was driving so rough and just kept going on the highway. We asked him to just stop and let us go but he said he can't coz he won't get paid then. At last we have to tell him that if he doesn't stop we will call 911. He just suddenly applied the breaks and we escaped the accident by mere inches. Finally he let us got off whrn we said we will pay him in cash and we realized we were in some different city. We took a taxi and came home. Uber charged us the extra fare and the trip cost us 130 $ what would have been just 12-15$. The worst and scariest experience of my life. So please just be careful as anyone can register with uber so you never know who you gonna trust.,1,0

"You can't pay cash on Uber, so you can't control how much they put on your card.  A driverthat Uber seems to support is to not show your trip as ended.  So. The driver picked up my girlfriend and dropped her at my house, both addresses were input in the App, but she got no receipt that day as the trip according to Uber wasn't ended until over 20 hours and 50 miles.  I assume the driver defrauded us, or there was a glitch in their software, but after days of correspondence and sending a copy of the receipt, I still get the run-around.

"Uber cab service is pathetic in India & you'll feel cheated everytime you travel with them. They will charge cancellation fee of Rs. 80 everytime the booking is cancelled by the cab driver due to his own reasons. Their so called promo codes never work and after paying the driver you have to lodge a written complain through your mail id or Uber app to resolve the issues and this normally takes between 24-72 hours to get resolved. Uber will refund the money and credit it in your uber account, so to use that you again have to book a cab. This is how uber forcefully tries to retain their customers.
The drivers are unprofessional. Customer support too is very poor in India. Their app is not up to the mark and multiple issues arise during payment.",3,1

The passengers constantly complained to me about the App's functionality, and the inability of contacting Uber Customer Support.

The cost of driving for Uber is too high.  Car payment, fuel, oil changes, Uber Fee, and Passenger Fee, leaves minimum wages for the driver.  While Uber claims that drivers can make great money, it's actually Uber that is making ""great"" money!!

"I've been driving and riding with Uber for 3 months and I have completed about 500 trips. Overall, my experience has been very good. I don't like Uber's rating system...which allows angry, depressed, and drunk people an opportunity to rate you poorly. The pay is crappy. Net of expenses I might make minimum wage. My last trip was 3.2 miles, 10 minutes. I made 5.18. I have done 5 trips in Boise, been online 5.5 hrs. and made 23.48. (Tues) That's it.

That's the downside. The upside is that I work when I want with no micro manager looking over me. 95% of the passengers are excellent, decent people. It's always the 5% that cause all of the problems. Vaping, sneaking drinks in the car, screaming and yelling. I had a kid call me a cracker. So there's always that.

I read a lot of the reviews on this page. Some ring true, some I think are complete BS. The passengers I talk to (virtually all of them) love Uber. One guy told me he cannot afford to own a car- he simply Ubers everywhere and saves the expense. He uses Uber 40 times a month which costs him 200-250 or about half the cost of a car, insurance, gas, and oil.

I almost said something thinking to myself this guy wouldn't start going before everyone was in the car.  WRONG.  HE STARTED ROLLING.

"When I started driving UBER, on the surface it looked good. It became very obvious, very faster than obvious, what UBER is really about, NOT: ""Delivering Quality Rides""!

Putting up with a rider's:
- dumb comments
- insults
- arrogance
- unfair demands
- demand to break traffic rules
- impatience

I received an unusual phone call from your company this afternoon that made me so uncomfortable that I had to hang up. The man on the phone had a hard time speaking clear English and said that he had contacted the driver but failed to Answer any questions pertaining to the wallet, even when asked directly. The phone call seemed like it was coming from over seas. Unless it was a mock phone call, it has made me begin to question the legitimacy of your company. I have spoken with a lawyer, the police, an investigator, and the attorney general's office. Further action on this matter will be addressed within the next few days because your customer service has failed to make the slightest advancement in helping me. I have been in contact with you for the past 8 hours and have yet to receive the smallest details about my driver, such as his last name, despite the fact that your employee has committed a felony against one of your customers.

"If you are contemplating driving for Uber in NJ, think again....maybe 3x. Ask around. All I know from my experience as a driver for three months with 500 trips under my belt and a 4.8 rating........be very very circumspect before leasing a car. What they do is rope you in as a driver with decent pay for two weeks....then wham.....they cut the fares in half. Let me ask you as a logical human being......can a driver who has usually a car payment of at least $600 per month...plus insurance.....(unless the ins. co finds out you drive for Uber and then presto....drops you like a rusty safe in the river) plus gas, and wear and tear on the car driver 10-15 minutes for $3....well that is the fare they pay. Also if you happen to drive to Manhattan......and they take out $20 for toll and charge the customer.....and then only pay you $8-15 on top of that to drop off the customer before you have to drive through traffic to get back into NJ to accept another fare which usually takes at least an hour....do you think that is a good usage of time and good pay? You see what Uber is doing is trying to show Wall Street (Watch ""The Big Short""- very appropo for Uber) the huge rider base. The problem is that the drivers are dropping out like flies because they can not afford to drive. I know as I have picked up many ex drivers recounting the same experience. Wall St......which incidentally I used to work for years ago for almost two decades.....is about to have a rude awakening when they see the market valuation Uber claims of $63 bill. -even though they lost over $467 mill in 2015-from a confidential source yours truly picked up devulged-is nothing more than specious and a ""house of cards"". Now Uber's PR will tell you how wonderful it is to slash fares all in order to be more busy for the drivers but don't believe a word they say. It is because they are burning through drivers faster than the INDIE speedway all in order to keep riders happy. Good luck people in your decision but know that you had better do your homework before you get involved in such an exploitive outfit. BE DAMN CAREFUL.",1,0

LAuderdale Airport Mon.16 2016.I want a ride to the Tri Rail station.Once again I see on my cell screen, uber cars close,my credit card last 4 numbers, my pickup address and uber will not send someone because they do not recognize my number, which they have previously.

"Uber is pretty good for riders - a real scam for drivers, wear out your car for less than minimum wage in most cities - - the amount they ""claim"" one can earn is a lie and a few drunk riders will bring your rating with Uber so low they will fire you - - thank you Uber for firing me",1,0
"Uber""s software is terrible and full of bugs.  Sometime you can't delete a ride.  It will e fill in your home for you.  Sometimes in a different city. The estimated arrival time is a joke. It told be the car would be here in 7 minutes.  When I checked 15 mins later it told me the car would be here in 20 more minutes.  Keying in a destination, über will enter house numbers wrong.  You can not book rides in advance.   The drivers complain about uber as well.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. WITH UBER.  They are a ripoff !!",5,1
Uber driver has let the meter on even after the ride was completed. I lost my money because of this. He rode a good 2hrs on the road. Wrote to the customer support multiple times but no one seems to care as soon as I explained my situation. They didn't even bother to reply.,1,0
"Uber takes out all hard earned money of the driver and encashs persons need
They deduct around 35-40% for the fate charges 
For ex if the fate was $10.00 for 3 miles 20 min journey in downtown 
Uber takes close to $4.00 and gives the uber driver $6.00 
In the $6 driver spends his time drives his own CST on his own maintenance and buys gas in his own

The Uber car never showed, neither did the cabs I called to pick me up from a retirement community in West Palm Beach two days after my father died. I missed my flight and now I'm worried Uber will charge my card or use it illegally since the app requires you to input your payment information into their system before the car pickup is authorized. At least the cabs I called don't have me locked into a financial trap. Definitely not a fan of a business taking my personal information without providing me a service. I selected a 1 for rating only because this site requires a rating but Uber gets a Zero from me.",1,0

"These uber drivers have no experience and who knows if the driver is on drugs or selling drugs in his car. Government is actually making it easier for public to easily access drugs. 

Taxi drivers are more reliable because they go through proper training! Taxi drivers have commercial insurance and their cars are inspected by county officers  whereas uber doesn't even have enough customer service representatives. 

What would government do if one of these uber drivers rape or kill somebody or kidnap one of their clients for ransom and who knows if it's the same driver and these drivers don't even have to go through any kind of training. 

This uber put lot of taxi drivers out of work! i don't think it's fair because this uber service is just extra money for some greedy people. Taxi drivers were working hard to raise their families so i think government should think about those families and ban uber and lyft forever so people can feel more safe!Tip for consumers: let's all come together and protest against this and get it banned!!!",1,0
"While I understand all of the cab-hating, the one point I worry about is insurance with Uber et al. This article talks about major injuries people experienced.

"More than once I've had to witness UBER drivers not following the laws of the road. For instance - one driver was driving on top of bicycle lanes and areas not meant for moving cars; another time, another driver was on a side street at a stop sign but made an inappropriate gesture with his hand and halted traffic moving along a busy road so that he could cross over despite not having the right of way.  It's not just infuriating, it is beyond unsafe to have these untrained, unregulated, unruly drivers be allowed to engage in such a profession and endanger the lives of others. They might have provided faster service, and maybe this is what they think will give them better ratings and reviews, but I would rather be alive and it is beyond shameful that UBER does nothing to discourage and prevent this sort of recklessness.",1,0

"My daughter, a college student went out and had expected her ride to be $37.00 home as it had been in the past. As a result of you ""price surge policy"" she was charged $160.00! It was 1 am, pouring rain so she had no other options at that point or she would not have used Uber. The thing is, she and her friend never expected it to cost so much, and like so many other peopIe are stuck, desperate and are open to being gouged and taken advantage of. I have used uber as well for over a year and a half. My boyfriend also registered to become a driver but decided not to follow through. I am sad to say I disagree with your surge policy. I can understand a ""surcharge""--even doubling the fare but this was unreasonable.

"At about 11pm my friends and I ordered an uber that was about $30. At 3am i ordered another uber to go back to our initial destination in which we took the same route, same distance, same everything and it was $86.!!!! On top of that, it was my first ever uber ride under my name and card so I SHOULD have received a first time uber user free ride, but the app never gave me one... So obviously I googled a different promo code that gave me $15 discount. So my uber fare would have been $100! I might as well have taken a taxi or risked driving my own car for 3x cheaper than uber. I thought uber was supposed to be a cheaper, easier, efficient alternative to getting a taxi or even renting a car? I will say my experience was polar opposite. I'm never using uber under my name ever again. My driver was nice though, a nice car too. But he took 15 minutes longer than my first driver and he barely spoke English. He also took 10 minutes longer than the ETA to get to us.

So here I am emailing uber back and forth asking them to honor their first time user free ride. $86 is NOT WORTH IT.",1,0

Okay so this Friday I went to an event in downtown and I decided to take uber home because I was tired thinking this would be a good idea.  First driver passes by me I am waving and he cancels I get charged $10. I should of just taken the bus but I order a second one, he sees me right away and he drives. Well I wasn't drunk just super buzzed.. I notice this guy is taking a diffrent route like way off and he got off far from where my address was and was driving so slow but I don't say anything. Until the next day when I see my receipt not only did my heart stopped seeing how much I got charged 194 dollars plus the ten from the other driver, I was soo angry and the time on the receipt said 2:00 to 5:00 am so this guy didn't turn off his uber, he probably thought she's drunk she won't notice..well I was trying to fight for this because what this guy is a scam like I get it we all need money but too step this low to get money is not correct. Soo after a few messages with uber there only going to give me $100 back but I am still going getting charged $86 like wtf that's still too much and after being super angry and what that driver did I don't want too pay anything..I don't think I'll be using uber anymore shady money hungry people.",2,0

The founders and management of Uber have gotten rich on the backs of poor drivers who don't know how to calculate the full cost of driving for Uber.  They make a very tiny percentage or they often lose money because Uber pays them LESS than the true cost of driving and maintaining a vehicle in the U.S.,1,0
"It is quite obvious that the majority of the reviews here are being submitted by Lyft/SideCar associates and cab drivers. There are many tip-offs that support this fact. The reviews with the improper grammar, choppy sentences, and misspellings (even with spellcheck) are mostly cab driver reviews or reviews entered on behalf of them. The more sophisticated and technical reviews that describe the theories, methods, and inner workings of Uber and Uber technology are obviously Lyft or Sidecar associates. Hey, nice try though. If I had not been driving for Uber and using Uber personally for more than a year I may have fell for your BS reviews and stories myself. I'm not saying all of these reviews are bogus, but I would say that 70 to 80 percent of these reviews are. Geez...who complains about rates that they agree to before hand? I don't see anyone writing positive reviews about the 93 cents a mile fares or riding in nice, clean vehicles that don't wreak of cigarette smoke!

Bare in mind this is on New Years Eve, a 23 year old girl alone, with no coat, visiting her sick mother in hospital. I cancelled it on the app as he advised as I could not be bothered arguing, and it charged me £4 for cancellation even though I did not want to cancel it, he said I had to!

I would rather give the £4 to charity rather than these con-men!Tip for consumers: After goggling other reviews I have found it's cheaper to google a local firm, they will be cheaper anyway and more reliable!

The second one also cancelled after a few minutes and so did a third one. Now I was out of time so I called a Taxi cab company and hired a regular cab. No more Uber to the Aiport at LAX for me.

I read other postings and what happens seems to be that the driver do not make enough money and they also work for other services like Lift. They accept a fare and if before they pick you up a better fare appears on the other service, they cancel the pick up and there you are, back to square one.

I had to have some surgery 3miles from my house a couple of fridays ago in Plano TX. My friend set up Uber since i could not drive for 24hours and she cannot drive at the moment. The Uber account was in her name and account..nice guy picked us up..drove 3miles to surgery center..i asked my friend how much was the service...she stated it was on her credit card. The driver said we could call him direct and he would give us a cheaper rate for the drive home a few hours later. I'm still loopy on anesthetia but my frjend tells me tge roundtrip was 70.00!!! WTF?! For 6miles roundtrip...are you kidding me?! I slept off my drugs..then next day told her we were highly ripped off..and she needs to lose that driver's number..and i need to findout how to lodge a complaint. Well I do not have an account..so i cannot set a complaint..if i want to set up an account...and give them my credit card number..then i can lodge a complaint..I am not about to give them my credit card number!!!! So make sure you get an rate estimate ahead of time...maybe in writting.. I am going to my friend and request her account info so I can lodge a proper complaint.

"I used Über a few months ago when I needed a ride after I turned in my lease. My leasing agent made arrangements for an Über driver to return me to my home. I had no idea that Uber drivers used their own personal vehicles to transport their customers. When the Über driver showed up he was on time. However his car was another story. It was an old well worn Ford Fusion that reeked from those cheap car interior deodorizers. The car was running poorly and was making a terrible whine at freeway speeds. I was gritting my teeth the entire ten mile ride wondering if this old clunker was going to detonate at any second.

"I have seen both sides to the Uber Coin and trained  people in customer service.  In this regard the Uber APP which if you accept as a driver or rider, are now a slave too and the APP is flawed for both parties, without any personal interaction, which is a major flaw in relation to Customer Service. 

I can give you loads of stories of when the APP has failed for many different reasons and Uber taking no responsibility for a flawed APP especially on an android phone.

You work your butt off under Uber to ends meet and Uber takes 20% of all fares before tax, so surging is required so they get more money not the driver.  

As this is an arrangement between three different parties with no mediator, your ethic or values will determine if this will become so called great company based on customer service or not, the current situation for drivers and the demands put these private drivers under to have access to the APP are difficult, yet your response even with new drivers to the industry, will get a go or not, if you give them a low rating like 4 out of 5.  Anything lower than a 4 from a client get ready for a meeting with Uber, so just remember if you are in a bad mood don't give driver a low rating for your mood swing they will loose their jobs.

I declined again feeling it was a scam and took a regular taxi at that point.  Scamming passengers is a horrible way to do business.",1,0

"I am done with Uber! Have been using them for couple of months in NYC, until very recently most drivers were fine though I was never a fan of the surge pricing (I paid over $40 for less than 2 miles). Early this week I called for a car, supposed to be a 5 minute wait turned into 20 minutes. I texted and called the driver multiple times but no response. Then he cancelled the ride without my consent, and had the nerve to charge me a $10 fee! Why should I pay for no service, especially the driver was the one who cancelled, not me! He was a no-show and I ended up walking few blocks to catch a cab and late for a meeting, after wasted close to half an hour waiting! The worse thing is, there isn't a customer service number to call. I emailed Uber support and they took a while to respond. I was offer a ride credit but I demanded a refund, as I had no intention to use them again. I filed disputes with both PayPal and my credit card, then all of a sudden Uber freezed my account. They have multiple agents contacting me and asked for photo ID and credit card copy...why would I do that? It's fraud waiting to happen, and can't be legal!

"I need to warn all of you Uber drivers about Ubers $1,000 00 deductible through their insurance coverage.  I was on my way to pick up a passenger when I was hit by another vehicle.  Right away, I reported it to Uber in the San Francisco office.  A staff member insisted I contact my insurance company and report it to them.  I insisted this was not appropriate since I was on my way to a pick-up a Uber rider.  After much-to-do, I finally contacted my insurance company and they informed me I have no coverage at the time since I was picking up a Uber passenger. Afterwards, I went back to the Uber office  at which time the Uber rep. informed me that I had a $1,000.00 deductible through Uber's insurance. The upshot is that I was lucky the other ddriver had insurance.  Since it was urgent I get back on the road and I knew Uber's staff would not get me back on the road for several weeks, I decided to take the issue in hand myself and contacted the other driver's insurance company to get the repairs done.  

I hope Uber drivers are able to unionize in the Bay Area.  With a union backing Uber drivers, we won't be denied customer tips, and employee support for such things as insurance coverage with no deductible while on Uber time, better wages for the wear and tear on our cars, mileage reimbursment for travel time back to the original customer pick-up if we can't get a fare back to the original pick up or within 6 miles of origiinal pick up. 

Regarding Uber's Customer Service to their drivers - service is below par. Also, please be aware, with no notification, Uber will shut you down as a driver if you report an accident to them until you obtain another vehicle inspection.",1,0

"I USE to drive for Uber but no more. Uber screws their drivers over...especially when they offer the guaranteed rates. You can never find out exactly how you're doing to see if you still qualify for the guarantee so you have to continue driving the entire 30-50 hrs to find out you did not qualify because of some stupid technicality....like 89.3% acceptance rate.

They also screw over their customers. I had a rider get into my car by mistake so she still wanted to ride with me. When she cancelled her original request they charged her a $5 fee & when she put in another request while sitting in my car it gave her a different driver so she had to keep cancelling those drivers while being charged a cancellation fee until the uber app gave her my car as the right driver.

Unlike Lyft, Uber does not pay too fees either.Tip for consumers: Use Lyft",1,0
"I will never be using Uber again, and I registered a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Uber charged my credit card for a cancellation when it is THEIR driver who cancelled, not me. I thought it was a good faith mistake, but what was their rectification? ""Future credits"". Appalling! They took MY MONEY, and now they want me to use their service to get MY MONEY back. My only regret is that I cannot do more than register my BBB complaint, plaster my situation on social media, and stop using their service. What they are doing is illegal. Yes, it was only $5.  But, they do not have a right to take $5 out of my pocket while not delivering any service to me. Again, THEIR DRIVER CANCELLED! Is this a new business model for them? Have their drivers cancel and charge the customers money so they make money without having to spend any time delivering the service? Incredible. I have removed all valid credit cards from this account so they can't steal more money from me, as they have proven they will do so. I have deleted their app from my phone. I have emailed them to have my account deleted, and I want nothing more to do with such a shady business. I will tell everyone I possibly can about this.

"I've been driving for Uber in the Midwest for eight months. My average hourly income after gas is about $7/hr. On short trips, Uber takes about 50 percent of the fare.  In my city, that means I pocket $2.35 a ride.  The fifty percent comes from $1.80 Safe Ride charge and then 20% of what remains. You can expect 2-3 trips an hour. Longer trips are more profitable percentage wise, but not much.  During surge pricing 3X and up you can do ok, but surge times are limited and you can only expect a few surge rides a night.  Last night was very average for me.  Six hours, 100 miles, $40.  Two surge rides, but only 1.8X.  I'm sure some of the larger markets are better, longer average trips, more surge, etc, but not really worth the time in a city smaller than Dallas, Houston, etc.  The Uber concept is great for riders, drivers and mostly Uber.  I really enjoy driving for them.  I put this out there so any prospective driver knows what to expect.  I'm sure over time as Uber finds it harder and harder to find drivers that the compensation schedule will change.  Until then I'll just Uber around for beer money and call it good.",1,0

"I drive for Uber in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I keep my car clean, inside and out, and often receive compliments on cleanliness. Uber drivers cannot be called from a time of more than 15 minutes from the pick up point, unless there is no other driver in the area. I have been called at 16 minutes without surge pricing. Speaking about pricing, in the Milwaukee area, the minimum charge is currently $5.25 (Uber X), of which the driver receives $3.20. The rate is based on $1.20/mile and $0.20/ minute (Uber X). Passengers often call Uber X when they should be calling an XL, but are rarely turned away. This does not give them a right to complain on that part. Customers are given estimates of the cost, as long as they put in the destination, and are notified if it is surging. They are allowed to cancel at any time, even after I arrive, without penalty. Fares can vary based on route taken, construction delays, accidents, and other traffic delays. I  end the trip immediately, as per Uber policy, when I mess up on the route, get stuck in traffic, or if the customer gets upset because of the trip. The customer is my number one priority, and I treat every passenger the way I would want them to treat me. The large part of my ridership is intoxicated college students, and they often get rowdy in my car. It takes alot of patience, which gets trying, to keep professional. If this doesn't sound like a job for you, please, don't apply to drive. I agree that there are problems with Uber, most freqently is due to GPS location with dropped pins. I suggest to manually enter your location of pick up and drop off, and contact your driver as soon as you get a conformation and verify your location. I notify all my passengers, when I arrive, of the address I am at to confirm my location is where they want me. For passengers, if you are expecting an Uber to arrive, please be ready, look for a message, and respond promptly. Drivers are paid per completed trip, not per hour, and do not make money sitting and waiting. Which is why I only wait 5 minutes after I arrive, unless the customer contacts me, responds to my message, or asks me to wait. I often get into a surging area, for pick up, and have to wait for a customer who never shows or cancels after I have been waiting. This is upsetting because I could be out picking up an actual person who needs my service. Drivers do not know where your destination is until he starts the trip, so we cannot decline to take you anywhere until we have already started the trip, after which we are committed to following through because the app does not allow us to cancel a trip in progress. I have never turned away a customer based on destination, nor for them needing my trunk space. I have picked up customers from grocery stores and helped them with their groceries, even carried them inside for them. I have picked up people for the airport and loaded and unloaded their luggage, and wished them a safe trip! In Milwaukee, Uber does not have privileges to pick up at Mitchell International Airport, or at least Uber X's. I often make trips from the downtown area to Waukesha, New Berlin, Greenfield, Grafton, Oak Creek, and Pewaukee. These fares are typically between $13 to $26 on non-surge rates. Those trips are between 15 and 25 minutes one way. My take on these trips average out to about a dollar per mile and Uber takes the rest.",4,1
"Well I've been reading the Uber reviews on here and they are hilarious. I just started driving for Uber this week. So far 5 trips. 90.33 for Uber. 66.50 for me. I don't think that's too bad. Could be better yes, but not bad. As a driver you can deduct all Uber mileage at the federal rate of .575 as of this review which will change your tax liability. This is a good thing. You will get to keep most of your money earned. I think the app works fine, would like to know where passenger is going before I take fare, but that's ok. I like the fact that I can drive when I want. I think most of these reviews are from taxi companies trying to take them out of business. No one ever is going to charge 300. for a 12 mile cab ride. You all are idiots. Uber is a great idea that I wish I would have thought of. Uber requires your car to be 2005 or newer. I'm sure there's a few Uber drivers that suck, but that is to be expected. Give bad reviews and they will be suspended. Cab companies beware I think your time has come...",5,1

Doubt me? Take out your rider app....look at a area that is surging and see how many cars are in the area....now watch as more cars show up and maybe at best a small percentage of drivers get riders. I've literally seen Uber raise price up to 4.8 times normal rate and saw one out of ten drivers in the surge area get a ride. It's all BS and I have over 2,000 screenshots to prove it!!!!

The car he was driving was a Chrysler 300, it had huge ghetto rims, I was seriously mortified being dropped off at my house. The car also had a huge speaker in the trunk, thank God I only had a small case otherwise it would not have fit and I would have needed to call a regular cab.

"Uber was wonderful when it entered the market offering an option to the not so exciting cab rides in our city. But since its arrival so many things have become apparent regarding their scam!

Cabbies are using this as their sole income- I've heard of maybe 1 successful uber driver who stayed longer than 6 months and wasn't doing it part time.  

Cabbies never surge charged (though if Uber fails this may be a unwanted result to even the playing field between the two)- unfortunately there were enough cabbies that did stupid things but many are not trying to scam you- especially now that competition has put them back where they need to be. 

Most reputable cab companies have strict vehicle regulations- I haven't meet many share riding drivers who even know how to change their own oil- and I'm hoping into their ""maintained vehicle.""

"Used Uber for the first time this last Sunday around 10 am from Chicago O'Hare Terminal 3 to Hoffman Estates. 

Unpleasently surprised by the Fare Cost of $76.94.
(Uber's Meter Fare:$60.50 - Gratuity:$12.49 - Booking fee: $2.00 .)

It was an Uber Taxi not a private car. I could not see an estimated fare at the time of booking the car. I took a leap of faith. Driver was Ok, not clear in communication but not rude.

I'm a frequent flyer and normally pay 35-38$ for the same distance +  $10 Tip (on average under $50.00 for private cars). My objection is not with tolls or tip but with Meter Fare. (The driver ran the meter during the ride and the total came out to be around $32). 

Sent an Email for explanation of high fare and some Gonzalo from Uber's help.uber.com replied, with ""Uber TAXI is a unique option where rates are not set by Uber. We at Uber are unable to control or adjust these fares.""

The fee is always around $70-80 each way - except for this Saturday where the in bound trip was normal, however I was hit with a $134 bill on the way out,  This was due to a suprise 'dynamic pricing' fee that Uber apparently introduce when they want to encourage more drivers onto the streets.  I should have checked my 'price indication' however I didnt do this, because I had taken the trip so ofter (er...a couple of hours earlier) and no fee.  Driver did not advise of any fee and joke is on me because I didnt read the fine print.  Offer by Uber to refund only half of this $60 fee.  Not  good enough in my opinion.

The driver said he could take me the 1.5 miles to my destination. I told him I'm not signed up with UBER but heard the rates are better than a taxi. After getting to my destination he told me the charge was $45 plus a tip and I said you've got to be kidding. I asked him to show me how he came up with that and he said he does this everyday and knows the rates. He refused to provide a fare estimate and said the fare was based on what he normally charge. I told him I think his practice is illegal and he started to use profanity towards me while speaking very loud and threatened to call NYC when I asked for the fare estimate. 

I told my friends about the experience after meeting them and they said the driver isn't supposed to take cash for fares because they get paid through the company. Needless to say I'm extremely upset and will never ever trust this UBER invention again. However I do hope to see the car again and the middle eastern driver. In addition, I'm going to file a report with the Attorney General, BBB and other regulatory agencies.",1,0
"Used Uber to go 12 miles, simple route from my home to office. I was quoted 12.00 on the application I downloaded.
First driver shows up 10 minutes late, wants to cancel on me because he is going in other direction. OTHER DIRECTION.? I thought they were a cab service.  Second driver shows up. He is driving a beat up, disgustingly smelly Nissan Sentra.  I'd have sworn he sleeps in the car. He speaks zero English, drives horrible. He blew through two stop signs at which point I said, ""stop the car"".  I got out, hailed a regular cab.  At my office I read that I am charged $37.45 for the 5 mile, horrible Uber trip.  
I call their office and speak to a young man named Eric, who tells me I experienced ""surge"" pricing.  So let me get this straight. You go on the ap, get a price of $12 and then because of some Uber formula, they quadruple the rate??   FRAUD.
Unfortunately for Uber, I am an attorney that practices in the field of securities and corporate fraud.  I will be on the phone this Monday with my contacts at state and federal levels.  This company is a fraud, CONSUMER BEWARE.",1,0

"I Live in Los Angeles, CA and used Uber for the very first time on September 11, 2015 The Uber App didn't allow me to place my promo code, which I was told by family, and friends that it was ok since MY First Uber Ride Will Be Free!!! Wrong... I requested a ride to the Forum in Inglewood, I live in South Pasadena which is about 19 miles... My Uber Driver exited off the fwy on one of the busiest streets, during the busiest times on a Friday... I requested to be dropped off, not inside the Forum Parking Lot but in the street since I only had 10 minutes to walk across the parking lot, go through security, and find my seats... Uber charged me $121.00 for one long ass ride, ahhh what happened to Your First Ride Is Free... After the concert I again request Uber... Same route it cost me $16 to get home, Yes SIXTEEN DOLLARS... Next day got in touch with a rep told her my situation, she informed me that it will take a couple of days for someone to get back to me.... That was on September the 12th Here I am on September 30th waiting for someone to get back to me.. Yet on a Daily Basis Uber will text me to become an Uber Driver, Really???? - 0 Stars",1,0

"Just started using Uber during a trip to Seattle this Summer.  During that trip, had a chance to use Uber about a dozen different times.  Then a half dozen trips in Portland, Oregon.  Just got back from a trip to New York, where I used Uber extensively, as well as a few rides on a ""Yellow"" cab.  In every case, Uber was extremely convenient.  The vehicles were always on the new side, clean and comfortable.  The drivers were prompt, helpful (provided us with walking directions, information on places to check out, and warnings about areas that were ""sketchy,"" etc).  Because your ride is paid for automatically via the app, there is never any fumbling with cash, credit card reader systems, etc.  Just get to your destination and go.

The iPhone app is a breeze to set up and use.  It allows you to chose the type and size of vehicle you need, lets you know how long you will have to wait for your ride, and gives real-time location updates on the Uber you have requested.  It also gives you the name and customer ratings of your driver before you book the ride, notifies you as soon as your Uber arrives to pick you up, and allows you to contact your driver via cell if there are any issues.  You are always asked to rate your last driver before you can book a new ride, which assures that Uber has extensive customer feedback, but can slow things down a bit if you are trying to book your next ride in a hurry.

Our experience using ""Yellow"" cabs in many cities has not been great.  By and large, have always experienced long wait times when booking a cab by phone.  The standard seems to be ""your cab will be there in 15 to 45 minutes.""  Usually, this works out to be 30 minutes plus.  Have also had issues with cabbies not wanting to do business with me when my ride is only a couple of miles or less.  In one case, had a cabbie whose car wouldn't start until AFTER we had gotten out of his car and jumped into another cab.  The cabs always seem to be ""vintage"" - at least five years old  - poorly maintained and on the gritty side.  Our last experience with a cab ride was from La Guardia to New York's financial district.  It was like the Long Beach Grand Prix meets destruction derby.  Lots of jackrabbit starts, swerving in and out of traffic at high speed, slamming on brakes - all in a car that hadn't seen new shock absorbers in about a decade.  My wife and  I were both motion sick, but were too freaked out by our fast and furious driver to try fixing our eyes on the horizon.

All-in-all, I am sold on Uber.  Highly recommend it, and personally will never use a ""cab"" again unless I am forced to.",5,1
"In Dallas for a visit with our son, who is a student at SMU.  Great Uber ride to dinner, but return from dinner a nightmare.

Am no longer the raving fan I was - and if it happens again will give uber up for Lyft or taxis",1,0

So frustrated to use the Uber app AND even on the website. Lyft is so much better, Lyft website took me 2 minutes Uber took me 15 and still I am not able to register as a driver OR passenger. How hard can it be to set up an easy-to-use website, it's not rocket science. Stupid company.",2,0
"I have a pending transaction of $156 and $75 from Uber. This was quite the sticker shock when this trips should have only cost $30 each. Neither of which were approved on my card. I have been back and fourth all weekend trying to get this situation resolved. I have spoken with three different representatives in order to get this resolved. It seems that I am just getting passed around an bullied to a point where I feel as if they just want me to be silent and just take whatever they say whenever they feel like responding back to me. This was sent to me by their customer service representative. 

When looking at your trip our records show that:

A pricing notification screen displayed a dynamic pricing rate of: x x1.3
This rate was accepted: 07:19:58 PM EDT
and
The other fare in question of $156. 82 was also taken at a time of surge and was at a rate of 2.8x. This fare was accepted at 07:07:57 PM EDT.

Uber states that I ""accepted"" this rate at the time of the trip. Both of these trips have starting time of 3am. Telling me I accepted a price 8 hours before my trip is completely asinine. This pricing surge was not given to me at the time of my trip. How do you conceive that a trip at 3am was given a surge price and agreed upon 8 hours prior? Not only was this complete lie given to me, I also was sent this information as just a statement and nothing more. Uber, you will NOT bully me into paying for this. Something WILL be done! You may not steal my money and you can bet that I will be sharing this experience.",1,0
"Our first trip was free as we were recommended by a friend who gave us their discount code. 
Driver was pleasant did not take long to arrive.

"As a driver, the most frustrating element is that the app does not work well.  More often than not, it does not recognize that I have arrived at the pick-up point and can begin the trip.  So, rather than make the rider wait I will begin the trip.  But this means that the navigation system won't initiate to give directions.  And, just as frequently, the app doesn't recognize that you have arrived at the destination so you can end the trip.  Uber's answer is to employ a small army of workers to make adjustments to the ride beginning/ending and the associated fare after the fact.  When I first started with Uber (only two months ago), the app worked well (80% of the time).  Now, the above noted glitches occur 90% of the time.  Uber likes to send annoying reminder messages to the drivers.  Time and energy would be better spent fixing the navigation app.  Uber is losing drivers due to the hassles.",2,0

Ummmm excuse me, why should I be paying for 30 blocks OUT OF THE WAY. I just paid 30 extra blocks just to get back to where we started. And then I got charged for BOTH of those mistakes. In addition, when he finally got on the right freeway I had to direct his every step bc he wasn't paying attention and was on the verge of missing every freeway exit. The worst part - uber only refunded me the 8 dollars in the wrong direction and not for the extra 30 blocks back to my starting point. Horrible customer service uber. I shouldn't have to pay to get back to my starting point. I was so mad I took a taxi home instead of my usual uber.",1,0

"Uber the rating game
Hi, I was so excited when I heard about uber and  join the team I was very proud in one month I did at lease 50 trips. It started a little ruff in the beginning because you have to get to know the GPS and that sometimes it goes crazy in certain places and you don't know what to do but do my best to get the rider to his destination safe. So I had a few problems and some customers are not fair weather they are having a bad day or not feeling well or just disgusted with life itself. Uber should really try to communicate with there partners and see if they can help a driver and hear what they say about the passenger. I own a 2001 2 door Acura and I had to purchase a newer vehicle to drive and so the passengers were comfortable my way of providing good service. I did my best and that was not good enough because of how customers rated us and there comments. The sad part was that I rated almost everybody with a 5 star ratting. So I get an email that my account was deactivated . I was loving my job and was trying to improve without  Uber help. I lost a job I love due to customers with no heart and a company that does not care about the uber driver. 
I hope this help someone and be careful cause the Uber driver has more to loose. I lost my job and I'm in debt with  a 2012 vehicle.

"Between comparing themselves to airlines and hotels at peak  season who raise theirs rates which they do but never by 5.9 percent of a normal fare or room charge. Dynamic Pricking ,Surge charge and robot customer service with scripted replys they are a rip off.    They are not transparent at all in their pricing. They charged $250 at 11PM for a ride that cost $30 twelve hours earlier.  The driver took full advantage of the fact there were many riders looking for rides. There were also ample drivers available  He raised his surge until someone accepted. There was no disclosures or an idea that he was charging $250. It is not clear what surge charge is   It only states 5.9x.  5.9x of what.    When you take a ride twelve hours earlier for $30 no one would expect to pay $250 for the same ride.

"I have tried on 2 separate occasions to get a ride home from Uber. 
The first time, the driver cancelled the ride when he saw that I had a cart full of groceries. I was charged for that cancellation, but later given a $5 credit.

When I went to use Uber again, the driver was in front of me, pulled up. I waved and he pulled away. I watched him around my apt complex. after that, I was charged $5 I was asked to rate the driver. How can one rate a driver when you did not even get in the car? That driver was given 1 star for not even attempting to contact me and for just driving by a couple of times. I was waiting outside before he got there. Literally, he was only 2 ft in front of me when he pulled up. He saw me and left.  

The last time I tried to use Uber again for a ride home from the grocery store (I contacted customer service about being left at the store the first time and was told that it would not happen again) Well, it did. The driver never showed and never bothered to contact me. He cancelled the ride once he got there. I requested Uber again, he cancelled the ride immediately. No charge for either cancellation.

"Uber use to be great. Remember when you got the first one? It was so easy and convenient. Now, they are worse than taxi's. Surge charging to 2 or 3+ times the normal rate, app crashes, poor drivers, and above all, weak and unhelpful customer service. Now any d bag with a license can be a driver. Some of the drivers even pedal coke and weed thru Uber. Other drivers hit  on girls and try to get dates. We had a driver pick us up in his pajamas once. Another driver had a tire blow out and told us there was nothing he could do about it and we basically paid double for the trip since we had to order another uber. This is no longer a company that is in control. Uber use to be great. They use to be the Nordstrom of transportation. Now, you might get the first car you click, or maybe the app will crash. Maybe the driver will wait 10 minutes then call you and cancel the ride because he's stuck in traffic. Once you get the car, cross your fingers for a cool knowledgeable driver but 9 times outta 10 the driver is out of their area and they have no idea where they are. So use gps, but it doesn't help when gps takes you the ""shortest"" and most traffic ridden route. After your trip, hopefully you get charged the correct amount... Or maybe the driver will contact uber and say your trip was longer than it actually was and they will charge you more, which I hear is happening more often now. At least taxi drivers have to work out your transaction on the spot and you know you won't be charged more at a later time. Taxi drivers are also usually driving as a career, supporting their family, barely scraping by.

How can uber company  determine the effectiveness of rating their drivers by passengers? What if a driver happens to drive at night & unfortunately picks me up intoxicated who happens  not to think or see clearly & I just hits the star button regardless which one. I just thick it's not fair to the drivers. Everyone have different views or opinion. Some can easily give a five or four star & some don't. For me three to four star is already a good rating. Five is perfect & no body is perfect.  How can you use this star rating to determine your good drivers.,3,1

"I will not use Uber again. When we left our concert on July 4, the only available rides were at 5 times the rate. There was no indication in the app window of what our total fare would be and I NEVER would have approved $111 dollars for a twenty minute ride. There needs to be more transparency in how fares are being shown before and during a trip. If you are booking a ride on this service, check the fine print and be sure you find out what the fare will be before you get in the car. Beware of ¨dynamic pricing¨ or ¨surge pricing.¨ Nuff said, I will call a local cab from now on.",1,0

"I have driven for UBER in Kansas City for over 1 year.  I have also assisted with the regulatory process by testifying in Jefferson City State House and have participated in a number of Uber charitable/community events in KC.  The greater Kansas City Missouri and Kansas metropolitan area people just LOVE riding with Uber and truly appreciate the higher level of service and safety that Uber delivers over the archaic taxi services.  Uber is also a very good company that treats its drivers with great respect.  The Uber app for Driver Partners is simply amazing and has evolved to include trip details, earning summaries and great rewards that rival many US Fortune 100's offerings.  As to earnings, Uber provides a real opportunity for drivers to make good money doing a highly rewarding job on a full-time or part-time basis.  At first, Uber will enter a market with a much lower price than the taxi services to help boost the customer base but they are also smart enough to know that price increases are also necessary to reflect the higher level of service that Uber delivers while still providing personal transportation at lower prices than taxis.  With the latest revolution in Kansas and Missouri Taxi Code to solidly position Uber in Kansas City for the longterm, drivers should expect to make hourly rates in excess of $30 per hour due to increased demand.  It's great to see that Uber, and Uber Riders, has elevated the job of driving for personal transportation to an attractive opportunity for students, single parents, single-mothers, veterans, ex-taxi drivers and anyone who wants to sup,went their income or make a good salary on a full-time basis.  THANK YOU UBER FOR PROVIDING OPPORTUNITY FOR MANY IN KANSAS CITY AND FOR MAKING PEOPLE HAPPY!!!",5,1

"I would give Uber less than one star if I could. I drive for Uber and was shorted time and time again. They short drivers and overcharge passengers.

"Heres the way to look at Uber from a different perspective. I live in Newport Beach California, I get up about 5:00 am and hit the road.  Trips to the airport are common this time of the morning.  LAX trips at least 5 times a week. Before 9:00 am i have made around 50.00 Take a break until I feel like it. Drive mid to late afternoon in by 8:30 pm I just made 120.00

I average 700.00 a week x 4 equals 2800.00  Nice little addition to my V.A. disability. You have to run this as a business. You dont drive you dont get paid period end of story. If you have problems with the navigation how about changing what your using. Waze is awesome with the Uber app. 
I don't see how anyone can consider this as being an employee. I work when I want to. I take off for vacation when I want to. No one is in charge of me to tell me when  to drive or where to drive. And for those of you who complain about the maintenance on your car. Well, You should be keeping the maintenance on it any way. No wonder most of you got engine trouble. Using your car while working is a huge tax advantage.  Oh insurance.... You are required by law to have that any way. A little extra coverage may be required but to me its worth it. 

Some drivers have bad experiences with  driving for Uber. If you drive in a bad area guess what you gonna get bad riders. But alas!  You have control of who gets in your car. Boot em out. Say thanks but no thanks and go on about our business. I drive in a very good area and in business areas. On occasion i get a really stupid jerk wagon. Guess what?  He no ride with me.

I have to say this is going to be my first and last time I ever use this service. I am going to be writing on every site possible about the terrible scam that is UBER cabs!

As a customer being my first time with uber and trusting that it should still be cheap I booked. Only to realise I ended up paying £102 for a ride which has never been more than £40!!!! Biggest biggest scam ever and never ever am I gonna use this service! After complaining that the driver took a bad route I was given an email saying the estimate was rigt??? Maybe uber should check facts! Never has a cab ride from London to Harrow costed me more than 40! Worst company ever!!they claim that they give an estimate of the fare!

"I booked a ride from Radisson blu Tonk road to Nahargarh fort in Jaipur in India. While booking the ride, both pick up and drop points were specified.

Even when we hopped in the cab, we told the driver specifically that we need a drop to nahargarh fort.

However, when we reached amber road just at the bottom point to Nahargarg and jaigarh fort (both on same way) the driver stopped and said this is the last point. He refused to drop us to the fort (any nearby fort). He asked us to get down at a point where there was absolutely no other transport service. It was scorching hot and disturbing. He did not move from that place. He said officially, this is the last point and we are not permitted to go beyond this point. A local auto fellow came and said he can give us a ride.

We kept requesting the driver to drop us till the fort but he said we are not allowed to go beyond this point. He said  beyond this point he can take personally and asked us to pay him Rs. 300 just to drop us till the nahargarh fort gate. We repeatedly told him to drop us to the fort gate but he refused and said either we should get down here (point which was 9kms before the fort gate) or pay him 300 and go. He also asked us to decide fast as the waiting meter is running and we are being charged for it.

We were left with no choice but to get down in the middle of no where. We also did it because of anger and disappointment.  Luckily, we found the auto guy whom we anyways had to pay Rs.500.

We felt cheated and harassed. This is absolutely wrong work ethics and I am extremely disappointed with uber service because of today's experience. 

I would also like to bring to your notice that the invoice that I have been sent, I have been charged Rs.200 entry fee for amber fort which I never went to.

It seems the uber app is still not able to track and locate its vehicles pick and drop locations.

Plus they have your credit card information but no phone number for their riders to call?? Its like they hide behind the internet and you just have to hope someone responds to your email. I will never use this service again.Tip for consumers: Take a regular car service.",1,0

"We used Uber for the first time last night ... thankfully we had a $30.00 first time rider credit that covered our trip to American Airlines Center. We had an awesome trip to the Mavericks game and we loved our driver and the rate was reasonable; however, when the game was over and we went to the app to get a ride home they had a ""surge fee"" and they were now charging 5 times the normal rate. We waited thinking the surge rate would go down after the game had been over for a while and even signed up to be notified when the surge was over. Two hours after the game we had a nice bartender at Pira Lounge help us get a ride. We had to pay $60.00 for a 20 min ride home with In Style Limo Service, but Uber would have been over $100.00 plus tip. Ridiculous. So people beware that they suck you in with a very reasonable fee then upcharge you with a ""surge"" fee that can happen at any time and leave you stuck or paying way too much. We never received notice when the surge was over either. I will NEVER use them again. Our poor dogs were 2 1/2 hours past due going out - I was livid being stranded with no reasonable way home.",1,0
"The idea of the company is great-- but the execution is terrible. The ""surcharges"" are the most ridiculous charges I have ever seen. I have paid $25 for a gross taxi ride, but that surely beats a $118 uber ride, for the same mileage, time, etc. No amount of snacks, water, or nice vehicles can ever make up for the ridiculous charges. I have had 4+ terrible experiences with both myself or friends with insane upcharges & shady ""end trips"". While I have also had good trips (at 4 pm on a Monday, or 9 pm on a Friday), the absolute exorbitant fees will surely keep me away!",1,0

"Uber Blocked My Account without any concern that I violet there policy of more than one account

First of all I want to confirm you guys that I never violet any of your policy I have only one account of mine which is iimsmba@gmail.com only .

Secondly second account is of my wife which is iimsmba2@gmail.com , yes previously she use her own name and mobile number but after that Delhi rape case done by UBER we threaten to use your service and then we changed that account with this mail id because during all this incident we get to know that UBER in no more safe for womens any more , not because of uber is unable to make it safe but because of the people you appoint in india are not at all responsible and not able to come in front to answer people or to resolve their queries .

Third I almost waste my 25 days time to promote UBER in Jaipur RAJASTHAN and in my company at Jaipur in given below manner
1.	I make them aware that UBER is not only that driver this is much more than that , and trying to release their fear from this company
2.	Secondly I do few campaign in my office to promote this company and educate people that how to create account and how to add prepaid wallet in uber
3.	Thirdly as you guys are also aware that in many of customers phones PAYTM Wallet option is not appearing that why I allow them to use my phone to create there account in my phone so that they can use their phone to login that id and use the services .
4.	I teach them to how to use pay tm wallet
5.	I transfer money for first ride from my Pay TM so that they at least feel the comfort and smoothness of UBER expertise , and I almost spend 5000 INR in promoting this service
6.	I feel shame some time just because of this referral when driver denied to come at given address and behaving vulgar some time in front of my referrals
7.	I done 6 colony meeting to educate about the Benefits for this TAXI services in current aspect 
8.	I went to my friends house and society and that time also I speak for UBER and promote this as an employees
9.	
During all this process  i referee so many people and let them to create so many accounts and earn almost 100 account from my referral code and my wifes referral code , and many times when PAYTM wallet option not appearing then allow them to use my phone to create there account and let time create they pay tm wallet also , and that time no one from your team come or call or mail me about the policy , but surprisingly after working of almost a month then suddenly I get to know that my account is auto blocked , may be system is not smart and work as per inputs and that is right also but when I justify on mails to your team about all this then no one is even bother to revert on mails , and even after blocking my services you guys still sending me mails that refer us and earn 600INR in your account and still my referral code is valid for others .

This make me mentally depressed and I feel cheated by UBER , and I feel very shame full in front of my referees and colleagues and every one is saying kya huva teri uber ka isne to teri hi laga di and so many other comments , I feel shameful in front of my family and friends also , and final again after that rape case once again this is confirmed that you guys are not able to provide customer satisfactory services in india and you dont have any rights to provide your services in india.

"I'm a soon to be ex-driver for Uber. I know exactly how it works, and I can honestly say this is the worst company that I've ever encountered in over a half-century on the planet. The CEO recently stated in an interview (video available online) that the AVERAGE driver salary is $100,000/year!! I probably couldn't GROSS that in (4) years and working ~70 hours/week, and it would take nearly twice that to bring that kind of money home. They're about lies, greed, and not taking any responsibility. You should know - if you ever have any problems with Uber, and you most likely will, there is no customer service to call (and they have your credit card information). They don't list any phone numbers for the riders or drivers. They hide behind the shield of the Internet. You will, eventually, get some kind of reply, but it is often in the form of a cut-and-paste/canned response. If I went into detail about how bad they exploit their drivers you'd think I was making it up!

"Uber is no better in Berlin, Germany. I recently signed up for their service and am now completely appalled at how deceitful and shady their business practice is. At NO point is it made clear to the consumer that one must pay for a full taxi fare when choosing the taxi option. Plus, the app makes it too easy to choose this option without explaining that the private driver option is only available on the weekends (at least here in Berlin that is the case).

Due to this, I inadvertently ordered a taxi. And even when I inquired to the cab driver what the cost would be, I was told it would only be 1.50. It ended up being 15 plus.

"I have been a loyal uber user since they first launched in NYC area. I had no serious complaints until recently. Like many other users on this site, i was charge over $250 on Halloween for ""surge rates"" which in my opinion are a complete SCAM. the notification about the rate surge was not clear in october, and the management team did nothing to help besides credit $30. TOtal BS! I used Uber again last evening during the rain and a total of 8 miles was $225!!!! How is it even legal to charge that amount for an 8 mile trip? Not only was the trip 8 miles, but the driver went in the opposite direction to avoid some congestion, which resulted in double the mileage. The car was described to be a mercedes benz R class, and when it arrive it was a black town car. If it says Mercedes, a mercedes should arrive. Also, i will be using yellow cabs from now on. the is no regulation with Uber, it seems they can just charge whatever fare they please and then send you an exhorbitant receipt. i now see why the far isnt disclosed as you are driving with uber driver bc most times there would be an argument on the spot if it was! SO many unfair business practices, i will be filing complaints wherever i can possibly file them. There must be more consumer protection and awareness for these type of scams.

Sadly, the verification against the same card has happened 4 times, but on requesting for a ride, Uber promptly tells me that the card is invalid.

"Firstly there is the service.  One day you might get a ride with someone who speaks the same language as you and is driving a clean vehicle that isn't dented, rusting or doesn't stink like the 9th circle of hell inside but that will be a RARE day if you ever do.  Secondly, If you find yourself outside of their preferred pick up areas, you are not going to get a ride or you will wait longer than you wold have for a taxi or legal rideshare.  Third, THERE IS NO INSURANCE.  Uber is falsely advertising that they actually have insurance, their TOS page invalidates any and all coverage for you once you get in the vehicle.  Fourth, their surge pricing scam is obviously NOT about a lack of supply or demand or they wouldn't be dropping the surge price once a few of their drivers have picked up people at THREE times the normal rate in the same area.  It is a method of keeping their vehicles in one area so Uber can collect more fees from their drivers.  It has nothing to do with customer service or actual demand and it destroys the green factor of the service as it puts twice as many vehicles on the road than would be needed.  This isn't even a real rideshare company. It is just a crappy point to point service.

"This is a follow up to my previous review. In Dallas Uber has further increased their cut of the total take while reducing the cost of a ride. Now Uber charges 80 cents per ride, a dollar and 70 cents for their fee per ride which they take off the top and 20 percent of what is left. Thus a minimum ride (a ride under 4 miles) will attract an Uber charge of $5. The driver gets a gross of 2 dollars and 60 cents while Uber takes 2 dollars and 40 cents. If you are unlucky enough to give a ride to an SMU student, the would order you to take them to a fast food place usually a mile or one and a half away. They make you go through the drive through. If it is whatasaburger be sure you will spend anywhere between five to ten minutes waiting in line with your car running. Afterwards they eat in the car, spill drinks, food, leave trash, and jump out of your car after you drive them back with out tipping. Guess how much is your gross? It is a wopping 2 dollars and 60 cents. I used to get so worked up about it, and I am not usually able to hide my feeling about it such that I usually get a 1 star rating from those students. Somebody would say if you hate it so much why not quit. I will tell you why. I joined Uber 2 years ago. At that time my second wife had just died of multiple sclerosis. I still had two teenagers and an 11 year old at home. I had to find something that would be flexible. At that time Uber was advertising $35 dollars an hour for Uber X. If you really do the math you will realise that even if it was true, it is not much. Because the amount was merely gross. And the hourly mentioned was driving hours after you have picked up a client. It does not include the time spent in your car running the engine and waiting for Uber call. Neither does it include distances driven to pick up passengers. If the client cancells after you get there then it does not count. So I decided that Uber black was the way to go. You make fewer rides and much more money. So I contacted Uber. Asked about car requirements. With their approval I took 48, 000 dollar loan to buy a car. When I tried to register it as Uber black I could not. I sent an email and h ot a reply encouraging me to register it as Uber X and then open another email and register it as Uber black. I tried to do that but it was all a lie. A year later somebody at Uber finally told me that they stopped registering Uber black in the same month that I was asking them if it was okay to buy my car to use as Uber black. To cut the long story short I had to run the car as Uber black. Later Uber came up with Uber Select and they let me register and for a while it was better. Uber sellect cost about twice the cost of Uber X. I switched to only Uber Select. Pretty soon Uber ordered all Uber Select to also do X or be turned off. Then t hey systematically began to kill off Uber Select business by always surging the price of Uber select. The alternative is to flip burgers, but it will not pay for my 900 dollar a month car loan. So I am forced to spend a gazillion hours (at least twelve) to be able to earn anything between 100 and 200 dollars gross per day. Thete that is why am still doing it until I find an alternative. What irks me most is the fact that everbody blames the drivers. The press make Uber drivers the villain. They do not know the city, they are not curteous, they are dishonest, etc. But who advocates for them? Who sincerely wonders how they make ends meet? What about the American tradition of tips? Why should it not apply to Uber drivers? Some will say why do they do it if it is so bad? I have told you my reason. But now let us look at it broadly. Maslow's hierarchy of needs? It suggests that a human has 5 needs that must be satisfied in a hierarchical order begining from the lowest to the highest. In order to satisfy these needs humans do what they must. However when one lower need is satisfied the next in hierarchy becomes a need. A very hungry man will even for to work for food. That does not mean that he is willing to work gor food only. As soon as he is full he will want other things like clothes, shoes, housing, etc. A person pressed to a corner would work for Uber no matter how low his take. Uber knows that that is why there was a time they would pay up to 800 dollars to get you convince friend or family to work for Uber. Now they pay 300 dollars. So when you get some one not knowing the city do not just give him a bad rating. Be gracious. It is only a gracious person that will give dignity and not take it away. That poor guy is trying his best to follow his American dream not knowing that he/she is a mere hapless pawn in the hands of the great shark called uber who pleases and woes her customers by using her drivers as mere fodder. I have much more to say but am afraid this is becoming too long. However I cannot resist wondering what holds us together as a nation. Our military are known for leaving no one behind. Why would we close our eyes to the plight of fellow Americans? Not long ago Apple was being taken to task for making their phones in China and paying very low wages why do we let Uber mistreat so many our country men and we keep quiet? It is cheap yes but would you sell your family for cheap stuff? Are we truely a Nation or have we gone back to the land of France before revolution? Are we gone back to creating bourgeoisie and the peasants classes all in the name of cheapness and convenience? Thanks for reading.

"Overall, I have enjoyed Uber as a passenger.  Unfortunately though, I recently had a bad experience with a driver and the customer service was worse.  I'm a loyal customer (having taken 28 trips for $900 in just 30 days) and was quite offended at how they handled this.  Overall, I love Uber but I am sincerely disappointed about how they handled my complaint.

On October 14, 2014, I requested Uber at 7 a.m.  The driver FLEW past my house and I tried to call them twice to ask them to turn around and come back as they just parked at the end of the block.  The driver didn't answer so I walked a block and a half to get my Uber.

When I got into the car, I was overpowered by the scent of BO and/or some other offensive odor.  I don't think the driver had it but the car was full of the smell.  ugh, I walked a block and a half for this pleasure . . . 

We then started our trip.  By the time we hit the Steelyard curve on 176, she was chatting away at me (not bad in and of itself EXCEPT . . .) and looking at me while she spoke.  I looked ahead at the line of brake lights ahead of us and shrieked!  We came within INCHES of rear-ending the car ahead of us!  YIKES!

After that, she drove 50 mph on the highway for the duration of our smelly trip.

I contacted uber that afternoon and the first guy said ""sorry about your experience"" and that was it . . .

The second person said ""we'll talk to grace and I'll look into it"" but I heard nothing further.

The third person said  and this is a direct quote from her email: Sorry to hear that! We'll be sure to follow up with Grace to check in and share this concern. Again, thank you for taking the time to write in, I've added $10 credit to your account for the trouble. While it doesn't make up for the experience we hope this will allow you to have a better one in the future.

Yeah, Amber - you're right, it doesn't make up for the experience.  Bad enough you don't even have a loyalty/frequent rider program but after your credit, I still paid $25+ for that ride?

They don't have a phone number either so you can't call anyone to complain.  You're at the mercy of email.",4,1
"Uber website needs improvements.  Fare quote doesn't work and doesn't tell you what it will take to work (e.g. what type of info).  I simply chose New Orleans and then said airport or MSY airport and Westin Hotel Canal street.   It should be able to figure that out.   When you clear results to try again, you can't edit the start location - you have to reload the page which takes you back to choosing a city.   Found it completely in effective.

Another flaky thing is that I log in and it shows my account then I go to get a fare quote and it takes be back to search city and implies that I need to log in again.    Hope they can fix these few simple things.   Using IE 11.0.96",2,0

"Worked well for me most of the time, but a couple times the driver took forever and looked like they got lost (watching the little map).  During that time, I let several cabs go by.  It's great when it works well, just wish it was more consistent.",3,1
I have had great experiences with Uber in all cities I've visited. Sometimes the drivers can be a bit sketchy but you get that with taxi's too. Good for cities like san francisco when stuck in a place or new york and can't get a taxi ride.,5,1
"I drove for Uber in Detroit for 1.5 years. They charged alot for being on their network and stole the tips. They recently deactivated my company (setcars) because they said I Defrauded them. Lmao. Ok! Thanks for building up my company and then stealing my drivers and bankrupting it. They used me and everyone else. Threw illegal cars on the road to undercut limo drivers and destabilized the entire system. They suck, period.",1,0

"I was an Uber driver in Raleigh,NC for 2 months a couple months after the launch just to check out what all the hype was about. First and foremost, driving for Uber is like working for about $10/hr(maybe) when you do the math. Uber charges riders in Raleigh $1.20 per mile. They pay their drivers 80percent of that or .96/mile. That is a mathmatical fact.As a driver,when you pick-up a passenger and drive them to their destination, you have to drive back to the hot pick-up area to get another fare.That's a fact. Raleigh is not New York City where you can pick up a rider,drive them across the city, and pick up another fare 5 blocks away. In Raleigh, you pick-up a rider, drive them 10 miles away,and then drive back the same 10 miles to get another fare(typically in downtown or local concerts etc). I did it and I know. I even camped out at the airport for 2 weeks from 7AM-10AM when 35 flights typically come in from big Uber markets. Very few calls to drive and I positioned myself so that I would be the first to be called because of an area I know about very close to the terminals. Back to the nasty math that Uber hates to talk about.Your .96/mile is now half that or .48/mile,because you have to drive back to pick-up another passenger. Gas in an efficient car is .15/per mile that you drive. Bro, now you are down to making .33/mile. Hardly what I call a good job part-time or otherwise considering you are wearing out your car driving people around. No BS what I have just told you here.Just the facts.1/16/2015 UPDATE!!!! Uber has now dropped their rider fees to .75/mile in Raleigh!! Amazing. Take everything I stated above regarding the money you can make at Uber as a driver and reduce it by over half now. They have added a bogus hourly guarantee(with conditions that are not within your ability to control)and have the gall to state that they are looking out for the drivers. Most drivers are actually losing money driving for Uber now,when they factor in gas and car expenses,nevermind making any money.People....You need to have your heads examined if you continue driving for Uber.

UBER SUCKS! MY DRIVER NEVER SHOWED UP. I GOT A TEXT SAYING MY DRIVER WOULD B HERE IN 3 MINS AND I WAITED AN HOUR. I never received any pictures email or phone numbers either. I CALLED YELLOW CAB AND SOMEONE WAS HERE IN 5 MINS. THEY HAVE NO PERMITS AND THEY NEED TO B SHUT DOWN. THEY ALSO HAVE NO COMMERICAL INSURANCE.

"I've used Uber a lot in California. However I used it at JFK airport in NYC. to Wayne NJ. It was very early in the AM, so no traffic.The ride was no more than 40 minutes and I was charged $269. which is unheard of..People in NYC need to know NOT to use Uber..",1,0
Great service. e driver was friendly and picked me up within 5 minutes of sending the request. App is easy to load. I was hesitant at first but was impressed with the service so far. Use code hsu2r and we both get a free ride.,5,1
"Please do not get suckered in to working with this unscrupulous company.
I'll be quitting the moment I get a promising job interview.  
The Uber company is completely unethical towards it's drivers.  When I started
2.5 months ago, I was all gung-ho but also paid very close attention 
to payment amounts from each ride trip - gas/mileage + hours worked - the 20% 
Uber cut.  It only took one week to realize that I would have to really be
aware of demographics, time of day or night, population density, where
the out of control drinking was most concentrated, what areas attracted
the most police, speed limits, pavement conditions, areas to avoid due
to distance travelled just to pick up the rider...well you
 see where I am going with this.  Efficiency had to be top of the list!
   For two months I was able to just break a little above even IF I drove for 10 
Hour shifts on Thursdays thru to Saturdays into the wee hours of Sunday.
    Oh sure "" You can set your own hours"", not really folks because the brunt
of your business will be on Friday, Saturday slowing to a trickle on Sundays 
after the brunch bunch is done drinking their Mimosas!
    Last night I thought of a new slogan for Uber: 
 ""Don't drive drunk, ride drunk with Uber.""  !!!   That is what you will be
doing, is driving drunk people especially from about 11:30 on into the night.
     I won't drive much past midnight anymore, due to vomiting dunk obnoxious
binge drinkers.  It is an ugly experience.  Trust me on this.  One male
passenger had to be literally carried by his two buddies down a flight
of stairs, he was out cold from extreme drinking.  He was military and was 
in good physical condition but couldn't stay conscious.  Yep that might of 
been a good time for me to refuse the ride.  But noooo I stupidly let
that crew into my SUV.  :(  fortunately no one threw up in my vehicle ...
Almost though, it was close!  Nice, real pleasant, NOT!
   Are you getting the reality of what can happen if you drive too late
Into the night?  Your precious vehicle could very easily get vomited on, 
maybe even some will get on you as well!  
   When I started Uber had a promotion giving the riders an automatic
25% off their ride fee, corporate made up the difference to the driver.
That made it feasible, if you were really efficient, it was possible to
 actually make a bit of profit.  As of the beginning or August 2014, Uber changes the rider
Deduction to 20% for the summer, BUT does not make up the difference
to the driver.  That means a total of a 40% reduction of rider payments for
the driver.  20/80 initial split for driver/Uber, then another bit of 20%!!!!
Now I made $4.00 to $6.00 dollars barely in the last 36 hours, 
Thurs, Fri and Saturday.
That includes $140 in gas, not to mention mileage, oil change and DIY car washes.
Windex and paper towels.  
Under the present 40% deduction , 20% of which was arbitrarily 
forced upon the drivers and not covered by corporate, you might
as well shoot yourself in the foot.  It would produce the same effect 
except you would stay home and not be bending over while getting
nailed in the rear by the mean and cruel greed machine that has been
revealed.  Plus your car won't get tortured by running for hours at a time.
This is my last weekend with these bastards.  Amen!",3,1

These people don't even check to see who's credit card people are using. I was shocked to find additional charges on my card that I hadn't made. You can't get in touch with anyone other than through e-mail and they take forever to respond. They only communicate via e-mail because they don't want someone yelling at them over the phone for their fraudulent activities. I will never ever ever use their services and I don't think any one else should either. UBER get a phone so people can communicate with you.,1,0

tried Uber X as a Driver in Atlanta. Big major mistake. Passengers were verbally abusive. Pick up location was always wrong. When and after the passenger gives you direction to where they were going they turn around and complain to Uber and they get a great discount at my expense. A 25 buck fare can easily be lowered to 16 bucks and there is nothing you can do. Anything worst would be working for free. Never again. Live and learn.,1,0
"uber sucks. I used them twice and I was obercharged both times. It was a big headache to get refund. A couple of my friend used uber too-they had the same problem like me. Both time my drivers didn't know where they were going too. One of them at least  was nice, but the other was rude and even cursed me. Uber offers $10-$20 free ride in the beginning. That's the way they get people. There is nothing free in life. One or another way YOU will pay for it. I'll never use uber again.",1,0
"It sure can be a great experience for riders, but not so for drivers. Uber advertises $18-35 an hour while driving for Uber, but it's not true at all. I drove for 6 hours last night and I made like $90, and I was busy. See, while one can get a lot of riders, many just want to hop a few blocks away, which is not worth it for the driver at all. The fare will be just about $3.20 or so, or $5.50? Taking into account that maybe I drove more than a few blocks to pick up that rider just to take him/her 5 blocks away?  Minimum flat fee should be at least $6 to make it worth picking them up. I actually have a rider whose fee was $3.20. But the driver has no way to know in advance these things, otherwise I won't pick up that person.  Let's do the math, last night I made 90 - %20 to uber = 72, now 72 - 17gas = 55. Now 55 - 10 a day for car lease = 45 Now $45/ 6 hours shift = $7.5 which is less than minimum wage. Sure there are nights or days when you get a bit more, but that still be around $12/hour, other days average pay might be $15/hour or so, but no where near $35 an hour. In addition, if my car goes over the mileage limit from the lease I will pay 15 cents a mile and driving for Uber my car WILL go over the limit. Uber, should increase the prices to make it worth for the drivers, and riders before you complain the driver this and that and before you give such a low ratings, think about the privilege you have by using Uber, and how this ride might be at the drivers expense.",1,0
"I have used it several times-maybe 6-7 and I found it to be easy and painless. I like the idea that I know what I am paying before they arrive, thus its my choice to use or not. No messin around with driving all over the place. I have seen coupons and promo codes too that take off 10-20% quite frequently. anyway, there ya go!",5,1
everyone knows uber  is fast but when you had couple of drinks at the of the night and want to go home the ride u paid $18 to get bar would cost you $54 to get back home. why? cuz demand is high. really wow there fast in everything,2,0
"For a service that asks for your credit card number right off the bat - they should really provide a support phone number. I trust you with my credit card information and all you give us is a general support email? I don't want to write you an email that gets responded to in a week when it comes to my money. People will be upset by this no matter what. 

On another note, I see a lot of bad reviews on your company masked by fake good reviews on Yelp. Way to go, Uber.",1,0
"great service, but hiring drivers who do not know their way around a town and only rely on GPS is unrealistic. Sometimes they just have to know intersections and how to get places without punching it into a GPS.",2,0
"Uber has several problems that make it a poor experience for consumers IMHO based on my own experiences:

1) Their drivers are not well-trained or carefully selected. As a result, some drivers don't know where they are going and are just bad drivers who would never be hired by a taxi company (which in my book is pretty bad). So your trip could take twice as long as it should, which means if you're late it's very hard to depend on Uber. 

2)  It costs a lot. Some fares depending on how slow your driver is could be twice as much as normal cab. They also use ""surge pricing"" which can increase the price of your fare. 

3) Uber customer service has a bad attitude. Sort of like ""you're wrong, this is why we're right"". I'm not saying their customer service is worse than cab companies, but I am saying my experience with Uber customer service was poor. 

So in summation, Uber is a good idea, poorly executed. I'd try one of the other cab hailing apps in your city (Flywheel, Instacab, etc.) because you're likely to save money and have a better driver.",1,0
"Uber is kind of like magic. You punch a few buttons on the app on your phone, and you watch as a black car appears out of nowhere at your doorstep. It's so much better than calling a taxi it's ridiculous. It does come at a price though--the black car service I've found to be about 20-25% more than a taxi, and the Uber taxi service was maybe 10-15% more. But honestly, it's kind of worth it. It's so painless...if only every service was like this.",5,1
