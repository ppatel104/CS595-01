0,Now here is where it all went wrong: Moments after continuing to my destination, I got a notification via the app on my phone that my ride had ended.I asked my driver what was going and he claimed, "Gee I don't, I have another passenger to pick up now and your ride is over so you need to get out now". This time he clearly played dumb, saying over and over again that he doesn't understand how is Uber app works, and I had to get out.Not wanting to argue, as it was clear that he had a new ride request for another that would clearly be more lucrative for him, and myself not wanting to continue the ride with this jerk, I peacefully exited the car where I stood in front of a private residence mid-town, shivering cold in the 50 degree, rainy weather, in the dark, having just completed running the 26.2 mile marathon and wanting nothing more than a safe ride back to the hotel to seek much needed rest, warmth and safety.And the driver still had the nerve to charge me $10 partial fare!!Not excited to be using the Uber app again, but not on a street where any taxis were coming by and not having another other apps installed (such as Lyft), I requested a new ride. The next day, finding the only way to file a complaint to Uber was via the app. I sent my complaint and within a couple hours was replied to with a wet blanket apology for the "inconvenience" and offered me a $5 credit of the $10 I was charged. Uber than wrote back with a full credit of my $10 (better, but certainly not enough to make up for the dangerous situation this driver put me in), and no mention of any discipline for this driver.I told Uber I would never use them again and would use Lyft from now on.
1,No text sent with first try at 7:30 am. More tries, no texts and had to give up. Four hours later the texts with codes were sent at 11:08 am. Two attempts were unsuccessful at emailing Uber headquarters in San Francisco that included a few lively suggestions. Then, unlike now, I had made contact with their home base, only to be treated rudely and with great disrespect. Perhaps a reply is better not forthcoming after all. I at least have a choice of 4 codes and might need one to request service 12 hours ahead of when it is needed.
2,Whether I am using Uber for a ride service or Uber Eats ordering food the service has been terrible. Out of the 10 times ordering food from Uber Eats 9 times food has been forgotten. Every time I have requested a refund for the missing item until recently they told me to refrain from this type of behaviour and told me they would be restricting my account. Not sure why I should be punished for their drivers not checking the food prior to delivery. I attempted to contact the driver numerous times but had no response. The driver cancelled the trip and I was charged a cancellation fee. I guess moral of the story is this company makes the consumer pay for their employees mistakes. Please refrain from using this service if possible, I know I'll be finding alternatives.
3,I am trying to retrieve Uber cab, with the same email just a different phone number that it is me? If you say it is for security and you don’t recognize the phone number, then your security system is **. if it was any good, your security system would link my original number to my new number which is under the same account and recognize that it is me. Why would I put any amount of stars when you serviced me zero amount of stars.
4,The driver could not find me which was ridiculous.He hung up on me and charged me $5.The last time I ordered a car in South Beach the driver hardly spoke English and couldn't find TJ MAXX. My advice... don't use Uber in Florida.
5,I had damage to my vehicle due to a Uber driver my upstairs neighbor used.The driver didn't leave a note. The driver didn't leave a note.
6,Might just go back to taking cabs. We didn’t get a good feeling about him from the outset. Later Uber retroactively charged my brothers card for $50.00 because the driver reported we had gotten sand on his floor mats.My brother contacted Uber and said that even though it was ridiculous in the first place, the $50.00 charge was not in line with their own criteria on their website. They refused to refund anything. Period. Now today, I see an email from Uber in my inbox. "You rode with Dario 4.17 miles. Trip Time 00:12:04 Car UberX," with the following message: "Adjustment Care due to different drop off locations. Ricardo (whoever that is), Previous charge: $25.35. Charged Personal **: $233.58. New Total: $258.93.". That is the most expensive 4 mile ride I have and will ever have taken. I have heard zero back. This is beyond horrifying. After now writing this I’m even more upset. 
7,Needless to say, I was not happy when I heard that my fare was 58 percent more. Uber says it's "dynamic pricing" and will not issue me a partial refund. with the company burning through its cash at over $1 billion a year and turmoil in the executive ranks, one would think the company might be more sensitive to such inequalities.It took me 40 minutes to arrive at a destination that normally takes 5 minutes...picking up people along the way/dropping them off.Needless to say, Uber is struggling with the "pool" algorithms and has chosen to not work with its customers when inequities surface. Uber has lost a loyal customer! 
8,Do not lose anything in Uber otherwise your experience will be a nightmare getting them to recognize you. Anyhow, my friend needed to provide verification about her account, no problem, except around 40 emails and 2 days later they didn't accept the email address from her account she provided at signing nor her phone number that she was calling from that she used for this ride.It's mind boggling how the messages we were getting back were not recognizing the very content info we used for the ride.Not sure where their tech support is in terms of usability. I will not be letting them charge a $15 fee for a returned item to say the least! We are threatening police at this point. Apparently the driver has something it's Uber slowing down this whole process increasing the frustration. 
9,My last 2 experiences with Uber have made me use taxis which turned out to be preferable to Uber.Two weeks ago called for an Uber and my driver did not speak or understand English so I immediately got out and was still charged on Tuesday.Guess I am on to Lyft. 
10,We waited, and waited but the map showed the driver staying at the same place originally shown, yet the eta remained the same. We thought that the map must be frozen, so a reset was done, and then it showed that the driver had picked us up and was on route to someplace other than where we were going AND WITHOUT US! To make matters worse, our credit card was charged and we were very late for our appointment. There must be a way for Uber to assure that your card is being used for YOUR trip and not for someone else.
11,75% of the time I'm extremely satisfied.
12,I would file a class action suit against Uber. I do not use this service and get billed! My card was taken and used. This company is not checking identification to match cards used for service purchases. There is no direct contact number to resolve these issues unless you create an Uber account. 
13,If I could give 0 stars I would. Uber has STOLE my MONEY and has made 3 unauthorized charges to my credit card. On top of that, they are not even taking responsibility for it and continuously keep marking my issue as resolved even though I have proof such as my bank statements. When I asked them to explain those charges they say they don't know and just ignore me and mark it as resolved. I called UberEATS and complained and all they said they can do is give me a 50% refund, and you know what? They DIDN’T give me that either!I have already called UberEATS 7 times now and they keep saying they will process it but they never end up doing it. As soon as I find a lawyer I am suing UBER for lying, for making unauthorized charges to my credit card, and more. It is ILLEGAL, federal crime to steal money. 
14,Here is the hurtful thing. I get this call from the Uber driver... "I am outside..." the way the exchange starts.Look. That lie I can break down! 1. Within a minute of placing the ride I got a confirmation from Uber… "four minutes." 2. Then I get this text "I have a flat tire. Will you please cancel?" I see this $5.00 cancellation fee.I smell a RAT and he stinks to hell.Finally the young fool has a callback number (I have a screenshot). Now I will say it was taken off my card. 
15,the driver requested a cash payment.so I paid him cash, later I found out my credit card was also charged. When I requested the refund from Uber they give me excuses by automated reply like it's my fault.driver is insisting to pay cash after completion of ride.Uber sent au 
16,I will no longer ride with Uber and leave a driver who may be unhappy in his or her job or having a bad day or expecting a cash tip to rate me as a client and passenger.You have lost a loyal customer. 
17,DO NOT ACCEPT RIDE WITH UBER DRIVER.  VERY UNHAPPY WITH MY EXPERIENCE AND WILL NEVER USE UBER AGAIN. I WOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST FINDING AN ALTERNATIVE SUCH AS LYFT!!!
18,I HOPE THESE FRAUDS GO OUT OF BUSINESS FOR STEALING 100.00 DOLLARS FROM ME!!! No company is too big to fall!! I regret ever considering using Uber. Lesson learned.
19,this is an isolated incident. We used Uber about 10 times over a week and had very good results.
20,THAT IS RIDICULOUS! Never will I use this company again. They are just ripping people off at this point.
21,Please explain.no use from your Customer care in spite of contacting.nonsense is going on.driver misbehaved. complaint at Police station. the driver has been suspended.going to file a suit against you. Can you refund my time & money wasted. Or else you please pay the compensation. Lot of time is wasted & harassment from your customer care & the driver.  
22,charged a "waiting fee". In fact, it was I who waited for the Uber driver to show up.  The "waiting fee" is a rip-off, pure and simple.
23,This has to be the worst ever experience with Uber.this is the worst experience and cost me a lot of money.Uber to not charge for the ride and to pay for the play that was ruined. 
24,Terrible service. No more Uber.
25,driver requested a cash payment.I requested the refund they give me excuses. lodging a complaint.
26,nobody taking accountability for the ticket.Worst support department ever.how bad their support is.
27,There is no humanity for "outside the box" incidents.they deactivated me.Uber deactivated my account and told me this decision final.They are terrible to their "partners", they do not have customer service, and they truly only care about money. low level of service.
28,bad habit. ruins the customer experience and make people angry. 
29,cancel the ride.lurk around the corner.damaged game of hide and seek.
